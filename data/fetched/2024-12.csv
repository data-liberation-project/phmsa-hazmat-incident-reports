The spill consisted of approximately half a quart of UN1824 Trupower All Purpose Dishmachine Detergent, which spilled from a box containing a 5-gallon plastic jug. The jug was damaged due to the shipper loading the box containing the jug too closely to another pallet, which punctured the container and caused it to leak out onto the trailer floor and on the dock as well. ERTS reviewed the SDS with the terminal, who turned down contractor assistance. Terminal personnel donned PPE and contained and cleaned the release.

Less than a gallon of the material was spilled in the trailer, fully contained, and no further releases occurred. The spilled material was cleaned up appropriately and the punctured drum was overpacked.","Due to the configuration of the forklift and trailer, the employee recognizes that utilizing a pallet jack would have been a better and safer decision to move the final pallets to the trailer's end.

The spill consists of approximately 75 gallons of a UN1719 corrosive liquid, trade name unknown, which spilled from 1-270 gallon plastic tote. The driver was cut off by another vehicle and had to make a sharp turn, causing the tote to suffer a large puncture across the middle. The driver stated the tote was properly secured and strapped in, and they believe the spill was due to package failure. The spill has impacted the floor of the trailer and has spilled out onto the asphalt below the trailer. The tote is no longer actively leaking. ERTS will dispatch for assistance.  Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 250-gallons of UN1719 product released to a 180’x20’ area of the trailer floor, asphalt, concrete and drain due to load shift. The contractors cleaned the release with absorbents, recollected, and containerized the release into drums, (2) CUYD containing floor dry impacted with product, (2) 275-gallon totes containing impacted rinsewater from the drains, (2) 55-gallon plastic drums containing transferred product only, (1) 55-gallon plastic drum contained impacted PPE, debris, poly sheeting,  floor dry, spent absorbents and straps and (1) 65-gallon metal drum containing impacted absorbents,  trash bags, and PPE and (2) 55-gallon plastic drums containing cut up totes.

Contractors were dispatched to the site to perform all onsite clean-up activities. Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of 0.5 gallons of BPW 76910 Antifoam (UN3082, 9, III) from (1) 330-gallon poly tote onto the trailer floor and asphalt parking lot. The release was reportedly due to a crack in the tote, impacting a 4’ x 6’ area on the trailer and a 1’ x 3’ area of asphalt. No drains or waterways were impacted by the release. The release was cleaned up with absorbents and the proper PPE. Contractors transferred the remaining product into a new 330-gallon poly tote to continue on with the client’s shipment and took the damaged tote off-site for proper disposal. All waste generated from addressing this release was containerized in (1) 55-gallon DM, which was then taken off site by the contractor for proper disposal.",No comments provided,No,                             ,,,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,8500,"EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND TRAINING SOLUTIONS, INCORPORATED",US,

The driver escaped the vehicle and called emergency medical services. h Upon theif arrival on the scene shortly after the accident, law enforcement closed the eastbound lane of the road. This lane of the road remained closed for several hours until being reopened following decontamination of the area in the evening on December 16. After the vehicle caught fire, the flames consumed the vehicle, 6reaching the shipping container and several of the unit dose shields and spreading some radioactive contamination in the general vicinity of the vehicle. EMS worked to extinguish the fire and in doing so, spread some contamination further around the area, reaching approximately 15-20 feet away from the vehicle. Two of the unit dose pigs were later identified in the debris, while another two items that may have been unit dose pigs were also identified. The other pigs appear to have fully melted in the fire and their materials released. It was not possible to identify which specific doses' pigs were intact.

On 12/20/2024 Sun Country maintenance control reached out to a FEAM employee to request that a non-hazardous material aircraft part be shipped back to MSP that night as COMAT on board flight 3039 and A/C N7907A. Without the knowledge or consultation of any Sun Country employee the FEAM employee also loaded a single portable halon fire extinguisher (UN1044) which was not declared as hazmat. This undeclared hazmat COMAT was subsequently onboard A/C N7907A for flight 3039 from CVG to MSP. Upon arrival in MSP this hazmat was discovered, and the discrepancy became known. There was no package failure or release of material during this event and the undeclared hazmat package was removed from the aircraft without further incident. Actions taken after this event included reaching out to the contract maintenance provider to remind them any shipping of items as COMAT needs to be communicated too and cleared by the Sun Country materials department. An internal investigation was also launched along with the filing of an FAA hazmat cargo discrepancy report and an FAA VDRP related to the regulatory violation that occurred.","Potentially additional training could help prevent recurrence of a situation like this. The internal investigation is still ongoing and root cause has not been determined at this time but it is certainly possible that the contract maintenance provider employees involved in this incident lacked appropriate hazmat training. If they were more aware of hazmat, their responsibilities, and what goes into shipping these types of goods by air they may not have made the mistake to load this item onboard a Sun Country aircraft without proper notification or process.",No,BOX,"Box, wood or fiberboard not specified",BOX,No,Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Sun Country Airlines,US,

Upon investigation, the driver found the 330 gallon tote of 12.5 wt% sodium hypochlorite to be Leaking. The entire contents of the tote then drained on to the ground. There was no way to stop the leak as it was determined that the bladder had a crack in it at the bottom of the IBC and could not be safely  stopped. The area was secured with no personnel exposure. Once a reportable quantity was calculated, NRC was contacted as well as TCEQ and reported the incident. An environmental company, D&H Environmental Services was contacted for remediation. The company applied sodium thiosulfate to the area and tilled the soil. Sampling was done and will be retested in a couple of weeks to ensure the treatment is sufficient. If more treatment is needed, it will be done at that time.","Evaluation of using an IBC with better materials of construction will be done by the shipping company, however, the IBC used was a common IBC used in the industry.",No,IBC,"Composite, with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for liquids and a steel outer packaging",31HA1,Yes,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA),,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,4370,"PVS DX, INC.",US,

While being transferred to a pallet on the loading dock, it was discovered that the container's cap had not been properly secured. Consequently, a small amount of sodium hydroxide, less than a pint, leaked onto the concrete surface of the loading dock.  Immediate action was taken to address the spill. Specialized spill cleanup material was used to solidify the leaked sodium hydroxide. Following safety protocols, both the original container and the used cleanup material were carefully overpacked into a larger 30-gallon drum for proper containment and disposal.  After the initial response, the cap on the 5-gallon container was properly tightened to prevent further leakage. As a precautionary measure, the rest of the load was thoroughly inspected to ensure all other containers were secured properly. It was determined that all other caps were secure, and this particular container had been the only one overlooked during the initial preparation.","This incident highlights the importance of careful handling and regular inspections of hazardous materials to prevent similar occurrences in the future. This incident and the associated issues will be addressed in two upcoming meetings: 1. The weekly safety update meeting and 2. The Branch monthly safety conference call. During these discussions, the event will be thoroughly reviewed, and preventive measures will be explored to mitigate the risk of similar occurrences in the future. This approach ensures that all relevant team members are informed about the incident and can contribute to developing improved safety protocols and handling procedures.",No,                             ,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

Contractors were dispatched to the site to perform all onsite clean-up activities. Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of 100 pounds of Spent Hydroprocessing Catalyst (UN3190, 4.2, II) from (1) metal tote onto soil. The release was reportedly due to the flatbed trailer rolling on its side causing one of the caps to come off the tote, impacting a 10' x 5' area of soil. Contractors also found that 0.5 gallons of motor oil and 0.25 gallons of diesel fuel spilled from the truck while it was on its side, impacting soil.  No drains or waterways were impacted by the release. A wrecker service removed the totes and up-righted the trailer. The impacted soil was scraped and collected, and the remainder of the spilled product was collected. Totes of remaining product were delivered to the consignee. All waste generated from addressing this release was containerized in (3) 55-gallon DM, which were taken to the consignee to be disposed of.",No comments provided,No,                             ,,,No,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5500,"EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND TRAINING SOLUTIONS, INCORPORATED",US,

Rybak noted they found wetness on the outside of the BOV cap and chains. The cap was found to be loose and contained approximately 1 cup of product. Upon inspection the BOV was found to have a minor leak past the internal valve seals that leaked one drip per 5 minutes time. Rybak cleaned the seals on the BOV cap and put it back on the car tool tight to seal the leak. The rail tie under the car had a small area of wetness approximately 8"" by 12"" without pooling.

In between the residue last contained and the full cars that were coupled together, there was a derail and blue flag applied to the rail track. Railroad personnel (on site conductor from Seaview) didn’t check to see if residue last contained cars were uncoupled from the full car (railroad procedure is for onsite conductor to verify that cars are uncoupled) and as such Seaview pulled the full car along with the residue last contained car. The full rail car also had a wheel chock on it. When the offloading (full) railcar was pulled, the bridge bent on rail tower and one liquid hose snapped off the pipe nipple. The railcar wheel went over top of derail and went over the wheel chock.  The derail is designed to stop cars incoming but designed to stop from opposite direction (outgoing). One liquid hose snapped at fitting and propane released into air from the railcar and hose. This triggered the LEL detectors which initiated a shutdown, and all valves were closed. The hose released until nothing was left from end of valve to tip of hose. While the rail car was still releasing an operator climbed car and turned a valve on top of rail car at 3:30 pm.      • 3: 25 pm-start of incident. • 3:30 pm-Site operator turned valve on top of railcar to stop release.  • 3:45 pm-- fire dept on site. No vapor cloud observed but did smell residual odor.  • 4:00 pm--Alex on site.  • Shortly after 4:00 pm RI Dept of Env Mgt arrived.  DEM requested report to be filed with NRC. NRC report           number 1418172. DEM contact was Jason Kasawa, 401-255-2910.  • 5:00 pm- The facility was cleared by fire dept to unhook railcar.  Site personnel unhooked rail car and                         derailed it and closed it so Seaview could move it back on track. Fire dept requested the facility                          to lock process on damaged arm.  • 5:15 pm-Fire Dept returned control to facility.   Estimated quantity: Less than 50 gallons.

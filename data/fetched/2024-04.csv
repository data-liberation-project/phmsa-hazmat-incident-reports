CPKC Hazmat mobilized a railroad qualified response contractor to investigate and mitigate the release. Upon arrival, responders determined the tank car had 80psi of pressure within. Further inspection revealed that the Kelso re-closing pressure relief device(PRD), with a setting of 165psi, was the source of the leak and could not be repaired in the field. The pressure on the tank car was reduced by sparging the vapors through water to scrub the ammonia vapors until Opsi in GATX 71080 was met. Wet towels were placed around the PRD and a plastic bag was used around the towels to absorb any Ammonia vapors that might have been released. The car was subsequently purged and cleaned, and the shipper procured an OTMA-1 to move the car to home shop for repairs. File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated based on the best information available at the time of filing. This shipment was offered as a'bulk' shipment, aka one car load, therefore the exact amount offered in this package is not known to the carrier. This carrier does not have access to mass balance data which can exactly quantify this value.","The Kansas City Southern Railway(KCSR)(DBA CPKC) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases(NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases(a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCSR.(Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Carl Akins, KCSR Railway, P.O. Box 219335, Kansas City, MO 64121.

Unable to determine if this occurred when initially loaded to trailer or during transit to our station. Upon opening outer packaging found one of four 4L bottles of water (non-hazardous) had somehow broken during shipping causing water to release inside package and eventually seep out as well. DescribePack: There were corrugated moldings around each of the four bottles to help protect during shipping but evidently was not enough to keep one bottle from getting broken. When that happened water leaked out inside, compromising structural integrity of inner, outer packaging and causing the box/moldings to tear and distort due to weight of 3 non-broken bottles. Bottle was already broken coming off of trailer so no knowledge of what directly caused damage to occur. DurationRel: 2 and MitigateEffect: Water had already leaked out due to bottle being broken completely. Cleaned up all wet areas in trailer and unload to re-establish safe working environment.

The employee initiated an emergency response from the CN Dangerous Goods Team. The tank car has been set out on an isolation track (SC98) The transportation Employee placed a bucket underneath the rail car to contain the leak.   A CN emergency response contractor was dispatched to the location for mitigation. The CN contractor found loading equipment was still attached and the cap was not attached but dangling by the chain. The attached loading valve was less than tool tight leaking from the threads.  The BOV valve handle was cycled several times to the open and closed position to free any debris that may have been trapped in the BOV sealing surface potentially causing the leak. The loading equipment valve was removed from the car and the bov valve was observed for 20 minutes to ensure there was no further leakage from the valve. The bottom outlet valve cap gasket was inspected and replaced.

Further inspection revealed that the shipment was not properly declared as a dangerous goods shipment.  The inner fiberboard was UN-rated and marked with hazard class 3 label, however, the outer packaging had no such marking or labeling, nor did the shipment have the proper documentation.

He called the WLE Yardmaster who then contacted myself, John Vergis, Hazardous Materials Officer for the WLE.  I called Specialized Professional Services out of Washington, PA to go look at the car.  They determined that the manway was indeed leaking.  The found that the bolts were tight.  They opened the lid and found that the seal looked new and that there was not any compression markings at the point of the manway safety bolts.  They felt that the safety bolts did not have enough threads on them to tighten to the point that the gasket would compress.  The installed a nozzle gasket, to replace the ring gasket, and then was able to get the lid to tighten fully.  I had suggested to them that maybe the manway lid was improperly positioned on the nozzle causing the metal of the lid to hit the metal of the nozzle, thereby not letting the lid close tightly.  They said they did not check for that and therefore could not confirm that idea.  They closed the lid, tightened the bolts and installed new seal # 8418988 on the manway lid.  They had also checked for leaks in the Roll Over Protection Housing but found none and then installed new seal 8418983 on that lid.  The car was then released for service and after the car was moved, there was no leak noticed.",Better securement procedures need followed.,No,                             ,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,WHEELING & LAKE ERIE RAILWAY COMPANY,US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, PCS Sales, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report #20240408-00072). Marion Environmental, Inc. (MEI), a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found a vapor release due to a hole in the tank shell nozzle. MEI personnel cleaned and purged the tank car to remove all hazardous residue.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper’s representative (Matt Paynter, Matt.paynter@nutrien.com, 706-564-8118).

Employees proceeded to open the container and observed many inner paint related material containers were dented or leaking inside the cubic yard box. Employees righted the inner containers, poured absorbent into the cubic yard box to prevent any further leaks, and transported the container to the ultimate disposal facility.","On 4/04/2024 the Veolia EH&S manager was notified of the incident. The EH&S manager investigated the incident and discovered that the shipper dropped the cubic yard box from an elevated height when preparing it for shipment. Human error did have a role in this incident. Veolia notified the shipper and requested that if a similar incident occurs in the future to please inspect the containers or notify Veolia at the time the container is being picked up for transportation.

When the trailer made contact with the king pin, a yellow liquid began to drop slowly out of the trailer, just behind the tractor. The driver was instructed to pull away from the van. A Veolia employee then went to grab a bag of solid absorb and placed it below the leak. Approximately 4oz of the liquid was spilled onto the cement floor before it stopped.   The trailer was then unloaded. During this time, the employees noticed that 3 drums were leaking from their bottom and sides. The bottom of the drums were corroded which caused pinholes on the bottom portion of the body of the drums. Employees then overpacked the 3 drums into poly containers. Approximately 4 oz of the liquid was released onto the trailer's floor.   These 3 drums were profiled as a solid by the vendor. Possible misclassification of the waste along with improper packaging may have caused the leak. All three drums were placed into a poly 85 salvage drum. The manifest was then rejected back to the broker, and the broker came back to pick up their drums.",Veolia has communicated our findings to the initial transporter of this waste in which they will reach out to the original shipper to place necessary corrective actions in place. Part of the corrective action is that the waste must be accurately profiled and packaged in compatible packaging and this will not be accepted until they have provided their corrective actions to mitigate future occurrences.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The CN Dangerous Goods Officer was notified of the incident and responded to the rail yard to investigate. The DGO inspection revealed a small amount of liquid pooled in the bowl of the external spring safety relief valve. The liquid was emitting vapors and tested as 1-2 PH indicating the liquid was corrosive coinciding with the lading. All service equipment fittings and closures were found to be properly secured. The product pooled in the bowl of the SRV was absorbed with a chemical pad. The SRV was bubble leak tested externally and was found to be leak free. The shipper of record was notified of the incident. A qualified mobile repair unit will replace the SRV on-site and re-qualify the tank car prior to continuing in transportation.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Gardner Asphalt, was notified via CHEMTREC (report 1395529). Marion Environmental, Inc. (MEI), a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and product leaking from the bottom outlet valve (BOV) with the valve in the closed position. MEI personnel actuated the valve between closed and open positions multiple times; once the valve was fully reclosed the release stopped.  Upon further inspection, it was noted that the gasket in the bottom outlet valve cap was worn.  Additionally, pieced of debris and corrosion were observed in the cap.  It is suspected that corrosion and debris present in the valve seat were the cause for product flow through the valve in the closed position.  Response personnel installed a new BOV cap gasket and secured the car for transportation.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper’s representative (Duane Thomas, 443-875-4818).",No comments provided,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1500,CSX Transportation,US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, Americas Styrenics, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report # 2024-0411-00185). HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the car leaking from the bottom outlet valve (BOV).  HEPACO personnel found that despite the operating handle of the BOV being in the closed position, the valve was partially open; additionally, it was determined that the BOV cap gasket was worn and deteriorated.  HEPACO personnel fully closed the valve and replaced the BOV cap gasket.  Because the BOV was determined to be faulty or out of adjustment, contractor personnel transferred the contents of the load on-site prior to forwarding in transportation.  Subsequent forwarding of the non-conforming car to shop for repair was authorized by OTMA.   The issues identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper’s representative (Vince Woolridge, 281-825-9424).",Shipper was advised to have personnel review loading procedures and possibly inspect bov gaskets,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,55000,CSX Transportation,US,

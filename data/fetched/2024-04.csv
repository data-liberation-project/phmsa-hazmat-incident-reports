Unable to determine if this occurred when initially loaded to trailer or during transit to our station. Upon opening outer packaging found one of four 4L bottles of water (non-hazardous) had somehow broken during shipping causing water to release inside package and eventually seep out as well. DescribePack: There were corrugated moldings around each of the four bottles to help protect during shipping but evidently was not enough to keep one bottle from getting broken. When that happened water leaked out inside, compromising structural integrity of inner, outer packaging and causing the box/moldings to tear and distort due to weight of 3 non-broken bottles. Bottle was already broken coming off of trailer so no knowledge of what directly caused damage to occur. DurationRel: 2 and MitigateEffect: Water had already leaked out due to bottle being broken completely. Cleaned up all wet areas in trailer and unload to re-establish safe working environment.

Unable to determine if this occurred when initially loaded to trailer or during transit to our station. Upon opening outer packaging found one of four 4L bottles of water (non-hazardous) had somehow broken during shipping causing water to release inside package and eventually seep out as well. DescribePack: There were corrugated moldings around each of the four bottles to help protect during shipping but evidently was not enough to keep one bottle from getting broken. When that happened water leaked out inside, compromising structural integrity of inner, outer packaging and causing the box/moldings to tear and distort due to weight of 3 non-broken bottles. Bottle was already broken coming off of trailer so no knowledge of what directly caused damage to occur. DurationRel: 2 and MitigateEffect: Water had already leaked out due to bottle being broken completely. Cleaned up all wet areas in trailer and unload to re-establish safe working environment.

The tote became crushed under falling freight  breaking the cap and causing the release during transit. Approximately 10-gallons of product released onto the  trailer floor, the asphalt beneath the trailer, and the concrete parking lot. The impact areas include the trailer  floor: 4'x4', asphalt beneath the trailer: 2'x8', and concrete parking lot: 3'x20'. A Contractor secured the freight for the trailer to pull into a parking lot where a tote transfer was performed and the trailer floor was neutralized  with white vinegar. The transferred tote was loaded onto trailer while the damaged tote was taken by the  Contractor to XPO’s Shreveport, LA terminal to be cut-up and containerized for waste disposal. Additionally,  one drum containing PPE, impacted oil dry, and impacted absorbent rags was generated for waste disposal.

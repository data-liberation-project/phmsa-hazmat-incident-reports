The driver was midway through pumping the product off, and went into the cab of the vehicle to complete paperwork.  When he returned a few moments later, the burst disc had blown sending about 2800# of product onto the parking lot, which was hard packed gravel.  The burst disc functioned as it should, so no packaging failure.    The driver immediately stopped the flow of product.  The parking lot is flat, and weather conditions were dry, so no product ran off the lot, and was confined to a circle about 15 foot in diameter under the trailer.  The driver called into his dispatcher, as well as to Chemtrec.  Austin contacted a spill crew to come out and clean up the product.  The product was containerized along with impacted gravel, and taken to an Austin facility.","The driver was given time off without pay, and has undergone retraining in the area of offloading product, specifically staying in attendance of the process.  Since there was no ""packaging failure"", we can only look at the burst discs  we are using, and make sure that they are not defective.  It is worth noting that when offloading the remainder of the product (after the spill), an additional burst disc blew.  This is being looked into as a possible causative  item in this spill.  That said, we are primarily viewing this as a training and driver behavior issue, and because of that will be covering this with our driver group making similar deliveries.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,6700,AUSTIN POWDER COMPANY,US,

The Driver of Truck# 575210 reported that he made a hard stop causing one of the poly drums containing UN2922 Catacarb 922 to release an estimated 30-gallons of product to the trailer floor and to an underlying asphalt area. No drains or waterway were impacted.  The Cleaning Guys supervisor arrived onsite first and stated absorbents were placed on the roadway and the spill was contained. Once the rest of the crew arrived onsite the trailer was offloaded to clean the impacted area on the trailer floor. The Cleaning Guys advised that a single 55-gallon poly drum ruptured when it impacted the trailer floor as the result of a load shift. Based on the liquid contents still contained in the damaged drum, it was estimated that up to 30-gallons of product was spilled. The damaged drum was subsequently placed into poly overpack drum for continued transit with Landstar to the intended location. Following visual assessment, absorbent was spread over the impacted area on the roadway. All drums were wiped and neutralized before being loaded back on the trailer. Cleaning Guys had to grind floor dry over the trailer floor to remove residual product. Following neutralization activities, pH test paper strips were used to field screen the trailer floor and underlying asphalt. The associated pH screening indicated a neutral PH. Prior to contractor departure, absorbents and debris were swept into a single 55-gallon drum, which is currently pending disposal.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED,No,DRUM NON-METAL,Plastic drum,DRUM PLS,No,,,,,,,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,14500,ERTS,US,

The fire originally combusted in the tractor for unknown reasons. The Fire Department arrived on site and was able to extinguish the fire. EnviroServe arrived onsite and reported the truck and trailer were both burned badly. EnviroServe unloaded the trailer and (16) 275-gallon totes of ""CSI-2255"", of which 6 of them lost all 275-gallons in each.  The other 10 did not have any spill but they were blistered and melted from the fire. All of the products in the 10 totes are contaminated by melted plastic and were heated up by the fire as well so they were not salvageable. EnviroServe pumped out the totes with a vac truck into new totes. A 100' by 40' area was secured for future excavation. The impacted soil area was secured by creating dirt berms to contain the soil area. No poly was used due to the large area and the risk for the poly to come loose. A 13' by 100' area of asphalt under the trailer was impacted.  On June 02, 2022, EnviroServe arrived onsite to begin the excavation, 50 x 40-foot area was excavated to a depth of approximately 2-inches below the original grade. Excavated material was directly loaded into a single roll-off container, which will be transported for disposal.  30 yards of soil was excavated and containerized into a total of three (3) roll-off containers. On June 06, 2022, EnviroServe returned to the site to finish the remediation, A total of 5 roll-off containers were filled at this time.

When the dome lid was closed and sealed either at the tankwash or the shipper facility the gasket fell down inside the trailer.

Additionally, Joseph McCann, CSX’s Sr. Manager of Hazardous Materials, responded to the incident along with HEPACO on the morning of May 30.  Upon further inspection of the car it was determined that the car had a non-accident release (NAR) of product vapor from the manway cover due to improperly secured manway cover bolts. Contractor and CSX personnel opened the manway cover, inspected the cover gasket, and secured the cover for transportation.  Additionally, response crew members applied thread lubricant to the manway cover bolts to ensure adequate sealing force of the manway cover.",(NAR CODE: 200 Loose manway bolts),No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3500,"CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC.",US,

No shipping manifest or BOL was available as the police took it when they arrived, but it was stated the cargo consisted of UN3260 (19 supersacks - IBC ) . The trailer and the tractor were separated by the driver and there was no release from the tractor. Hepaco Environmental responded for clean up operations and advised that all 19 IBCs released impacted the asphalt roadway, adjacent soil and migrated to the Eagle Creek. Hepaco personnel utilized hand tools and heavy equipment to clean the impacted areas. All waste was collected for pending disposal.

The hardware was reviewed by Excelitas and SNL personnel and determined to be material needing to be returned to SNL. The hardware was packaged and shipped to SNL in a corrugated box within a metal AN can. The shipment was offered by Excelitas- Miamisburg on August 17,2021 and consisted of 6. packages- 4 AN cans with scrap material, 1 AN can with packing material, and 1 box with packing material. Transportation was by FedEx. The shipment was delivered to SNL- New Mexico on August 18, 2021. The shipment arrived at SNL- Building 905 around August 25, 2021. The shipment was sent to Building 905 for sorting by the responsible product realization teams(PRTs) in the explosive receipt and inspection area of the facility. PRTs claimed items with continued Value to their programs, with the unclaimed items getting sent to Repplication. This occurred in September 2021. In April 2022, the(part specific) PRT retrieved the""previously"" functioned/fired LAT units for potential use in production of trainers, to include the unit in question. While sorting through the units, an SNL technologist identified a single(part specific) actuator that had not fired and was a LIVE unit(containing energetic material). Excelitas was notified on May 4,2022. Research into the history of the unit(SN71357) showed item was from(part specific) Lot 2 (circa December 2011) and had been used in the Neyer Fire Test regime. The records indicate this unit did not fire during testing. The unit contains less than 0.100 grams of TiH1.65KCIO4(non-static sensitive, pyrotechnic).","Both Sandia National Laboratory and Excelitas- Miamisburg have initiated investigation/root-cause, correction actions(RCCA). Initial results of the investigation at Excelitas- Miamisburg prove to be difficult to account for the identification of the RCCA because of the time Iapse from production/testing of the part(i.e. 2011) to the return shipment to SNL in August 2021. However, the RCCA continues with a multi-functional team with Miamisburg Senior Leadership Team oversight. Excelitas Corporate Leadership is updated with periodical briefings. Initial suggestions for corrective actions include, in no particular order: 1. Sitewide training on proper segregation of LIVE and INERT parts 2. Functional(i.e. destructive testing) specific training of operational controls 3. Procedure reviews for(part specific) 4. Development of general post-LAT disposition procedure 5. Procedure review of QP0759(Scrap Disposal) to account for off-specification disposal 6.

While exiting the intersection of highway 285 and 302 that is under construction the driver was making a righthand turn getting onto highway 302. Due to the road construction, there is a steep approach transitioning onto highway 302.  When the driver crested the incline the right passenger trailer duals went over first causing the load to shift left then the drivers left duals went over causing the load to shift right. Due to the high center of gravity and liquid the movement it caused load to slingshot back to the left with enough momentum to overturn tractor TR185 and Trailer T1020.  During the motor vehicle accident one of the CNG bottles on the trailer was damaged and a release of CNG occurred. The bladder system was isolated and approximately 10,300 MSCF of CNG was released.

Operator did not have the required PPE as stated in the SOP(No Acid Suit Jacket, No Respirator, No Acid Hood, Using dark face shield at night and in up position). Operator did not rinse for 15 minutes after being sprayed as outlined in the SOP based on an estimated timeline. Operator left the loading process unattended to scale out previous truck which is violation of the SOP. Driver was refusing treatment, Safety Coordinator instructed operator to seek medical attention and was transported by the driver. Root Cause: Operator failed to follow several steps in the SOP. Main cause is valve was not properly secured.","CTI had a Safety Stand Down with employees at site to cover incident,'discuss procedures, suggest ways to improve process to eliminate any additional risk, importance of teamwork with everyone involved with the process and to slow down and don't rush.

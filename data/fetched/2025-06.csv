After a call from the CSX Yardmaster at approximately 1733 hours, a Canton employee walked out to inspect the railcar.  It was determined that the leak was coming from the top of the tank car, out of the pressure relief valve, located under the top fitting protection cover.  This leak was due to the car being loaded during the winter months and the product inside the tank expanding due to sunlight warming the side of the tank, causing the contents to expand, thus reducing the available head space in the car.  A Canton Railroad transload employee came out at 1907 hours and pumped 200 gallons out of the car to prevent further dripping out of the safety valve.","Both the shipper and consignee will be notified of the incident and a recommendation will be made to load the railcars, leaving more head room in the tank for expansion of the product during warm weather months.",No,                             ,,,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CANTON RAILROAD COMPANY,US,

The unit involved was Truck RC-34 pulling Trailer 107, both loaded with chemical product identified under BOL 1150607. The material being transported was M2Guard-HSR105G, manufactured by Foremark Performance for M2 Chemical. The driver was approximately 15 minutes from the delivery location at the time of the incident. Driver Nutall reported that he was unable to stop the truck and trailer due to apparent brake failure. The posted speed limit for the curve was 15 mph, as confirmed by photographs taken at the scene, which also documented tire marks showing the vehicle sliding off the road and rolling. Actions Taken at the Time of Discovery: The driver immediately notified dispatch and confirmed that he had sustained injuries to his head and lower back, but no other vehicles or individuals were involved. Local law enforcement was notified, and Officer Cliff Lance (Phone: 318-426-499) responded to the scene. The Louisiana State Police accident hotline was contacted at 10:19 AM; the call was taken by Amanda, who provided Incident #2121, which was initially given by Officer Lance. E3 Environmental was contacted to oversee environmental remediation and cleanup. They will be providing a cost estimate and handling hazardous materials containment. Nolan's Towing was notified to upright the truck and trailer and coordinate safe offloading of the contents. A secondary trailer, TX-18, operated by Driver Alan Reeves, was dispatched to receive the chemical transfer from the damaged trailer. Description of Package Failure: • The trailer was fully loaded with 45k of M2Guard-HSR105G at the time of the accident. Due to the trailer rolling into a ditch, there is potential for container displacement or compromise, though a full damage assessment was pending at time of report. While no visible punctures, cracks, or leaks were initially confirmed via driver call, an on-site inspection was ordered noticed some seepage from washout cap on dome lid area. Photographs taken at the scene showed clear evidence of road departure, slide marks, and the overturned position of the truck and trailer. • Any cracked, punctured, or ruptured drums will be identified by E3 Environmental and reported under separate documentation. Estimated Duration of Release: The exact duration of any material release is currently unknown pending E3's assessment. However, based on the time of the call (8:26 AM) and environmental response initiation (around 12:30 PM). Scene secured by law enforcement to prevent unauthorized access or ignition hazards.

The driver then notified his manager and absorbents were set down to collect any free liquid. The internal response team was called to address the clean-up. They collected the materials needed to address the clean up and began transferring the material to another tote @1600ct. While transferring the material they laid more absorbents down to collect and begin cleaning up the material that had gotten on the pavement and the floor of the trailer. Approximately 10-15 gallons was released. Once the damaged tote was emptied they cut it up and repackaged it for disposal. The clean up was complete @1945ct.,When reviewing the information it was discovered that the tote was sitting outside at the customers location in the sun causing damage to the plastic. The plastic had gotten brittle in the sun and when transporting the plastic cracked allowing the material to be release.

Upon the contractor’s arrival, personnel observed that the released material impacted a 600ft-by-1ft area of concrete between the trailer and soil and a 5ft-by-5ft area of soil and estimated that fifty-five (55) gallons of material was released from one (1) 55-gallon poly drum due to the drum being forked. Before the contractor arrived, the facility personnel placed the leaking drum into one (1) 95-gallon steel drum with the top cut off that already contained other absorbent materials. Clean Harbors personnel deployed granular absorbents and a neutralizer to the affected areas. It was determined that a strip of one foot away along the concrete was going to need to be excavated. Seven (7) 55-gallon poly drums of contaminated soil and impacted absorbents were generated. The drums began bulging and it was advised that containment will need to be established around the drums, and they will need to be left outside to vent. The lids were loosened and covered with poly sheeting. The waste was staged onsite before contractor demobilization.

The incident occurred on the off-ramp at mile marker 191, temporarily blocking access. The fire originated in the rear section of the trailer.  According to the driver’s report, the incident began with a tire blowout, followed by a second blowout on the rear axle. The Automatic Valve System (AVS) failed to engage; likely due to damage from debris or the tire failure, causing the brakes to lock and overheat. This overheating generated sparks that are believed to have ignited the underside of the trailer.  Ingenium contacted and reported the incident to NRC (NRC# 1434197) when immediately available to do so.  The fire resulted in the partial destruction of manifested hazardous waste. Emergency responders, including the Murdo Volunteer Fire Department and Murdo Police Department, were immediately dispatched. Ingenium coordinated with its emergency response contractor, Ambipar (North Dakota), and worked alongside local and state authorities to secure the scene and begin cleanup operations.  Initial field assessments indicate that the majority of the damage occurred in the rear section of the trailer, which contained waste associated with Systech manifests. While many containers remained intact, all materials were transferred to new containers or salvage drums as a precaution.  Due to the extent of the incident, the waste shipments could not be delivered to the originally designated facilities (TSDFs) as planned. A portion of the waste was destroyed in the fire. The remaining materials were recovered, secured, and segregated for proper management. These recovered materials were subsequently shipped to an alternate permitted facility for identification, profiling, and compliant handling.  All recovered waste is being managed under EPA ID SDR000222927 (Ingenium Group, LLC) in accordance with Episodic Event reporting protocols, as the materials are now considered commingled with other manifested waste from the same trailer.

The incident occurred on the off-ramp at mile marker 191, temporarily blocking access. The fire originated in the rear section of the trailer.  According to the driver’s report, the incident began with a tire blowout, followed by a second blowout on the rear axle. The Automatic Valve System (AVS) failed to engage; likely due to damage from debris or the tire failure, causing the brakes to lock and overheat. This overheating generated sparks that are believed to have ignited the underside of the trailer.  Ingenium contacted and reported the incident to NRC (NRC# 1434197) when immediately available to do so.  The fire resulted in the partial destruction of manifested hazardous waste. Emergency responders, including the Murdo Volunteer Fire Department and Murdo Police Department, were immediately dispatched. Ingenium coordinated with its emergency response contractor, Ambipar (North Dakota), and worked alongside local and state authorities to secure the scene and begin cleanup operations.  Initial field assessments indicate that the majority of the damage occurred in the rear section of the trailer, which contained waste associated with Systech manifests. While many containers remained intact, all materials were transferred to new containers or salvage drums as a precaution.  Due to the extent of the incident, the waste shipments could not be delivered to the originally designated facilities (TSDFs) as planned. A portion of the waste was destroyed in the fire.

The incident occurred on the off-ramp at mile marker 191, temporarily blocking access. The fire originated in the rear section of the trailer.  According to the driver’s report, the incident began with a tire blowout, followed by a second blowout on the rear axle. The Automatic Valve System (AVS) failed to engage; likely due to damage from debris or the tire failure, causing the brakes to lock and overheat. This overheating generated sparks that are believed to have ignited the underside of the trailer.  Ingenium contacted and reported the incident to NRC (NRC# 1434197) when immediately available to do so.  The fire resulted in the partial destruction of manifested hazardous waste. Emergency responders, including the Murdo Volunteer Fire Department and Murdo Police Department, were immediately dispatched. Ingenium coordinated with its emergency response contractor, Ambipar (North Dakota), and worked alongside local and state authorities to secure the scene and begin cleanup operations.  Initial field assessments indicate that the majority of the damage occurred in the rear section of the trailer, which contained waste associated with Systech manifests. While many containers remained intact, all materials were transferred to new containers or salvage drums as a precaution.  Due to the extent of the incident, the waste shipments could not be delivered to the originally designated facilities (TSDFs) as planned. A portion of the waste was destroyed in the fire. The remaining materials were recovered, secured, and segregated for proper management. These recovered materials were subsequently shipped to an alternate permitted facility for identification, profiling, and compliant handling.  All recovered waste is being managed under EPA ID SDR000222927 (Ingenium Group, LLC) in accordance with Episodic Event reporting protocols, as the materials are now considered commingled with other manifested waste from the same trailer.

Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of 1.0 gallon of TRANSCHEM Muriatic Acid (UN1789, 8, II) from (1) 1-gallon plastic jug onto the trailer floor. The release was reportedly due to a load shift causing the jug to be smashed, impacting the trailer floor and 23 cardboard boxes containing (92) 1-gallon jugs of product. The release was cleaned with absorbent pads and the proper PPE. No drains or waterways were impacted by the release.

(TSU) CMV operator arrived at 03:25am to deliver hypochlorite solutions to customer Pinch A Penny 33's, owned and operated by Kristine and Michael Moureau, two 1800 gallon above ground storage tanks.  This was a routine delivery for the TSU CMV operator, and the TSU CMV operator failed to properly conduct an inspection of the customer's equipment prior to unloading.  Due to this failure, the operator was unaware of the recent installation of the new hypochlorite solutions KemKey connector and the disconnection of the old offloading line. The operator connected his cargo tanker unloading hose to the customer's old offloading line, which was no longer connected to the above ground storage tank.  CMV operator began the unloading operations, after a few minutes the operator noticed that the above ground storage tank was not increasing in the amount of hypochlorite solutions.  It was at this time, the operator investigated the cause and found that the unloading operation through the old offloading line was releasing hypochlorite solutions directly to the ground instead of filling the customer's tank. The operator immediately terminated unloading operations, thus mitigating any further potential spillage. There was no equipment failure.  The hazardous material release was due to the following:  1) the lack of communication to the CMV operator regarding the installation of the new KemKey connector, 2) the failure to remove/render inoperable the old offloading line, and 3) the CMV operator's failure to properly conduct an equipment inspection prior to beginning the unloading process which resulted in the hazardous material release. CBI was contacted to handle the cleanup. https://www.cliffberryinc.com  **** Property owner notified of the hazardous material discharge, and provided a phone number to the National Response Center (NRC). Property owner was notifying the NRC, and the incident/call number was provided to the property owner (not us, so the NRC incident/call number is unknown).****",CMV operator was terminated for violating a number of company policies related to the spill.

The driver then over corrected to the left, causing the vehicle to overturn onto its right side.   During the incident, the hazardous materials container detached from the vehicle and released its contents onto the roadway, shoulder, and adjacent ditch. In addition, the truck leaked diesel fuel, hydraulic fluid, and other hazardous substances into the ditch.

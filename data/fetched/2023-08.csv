Driver moved to the customer scale on site and noticed the turpentine smell and then saw a leak coming from the bottom forward section of the insulation through a weep hole.  Driver moved it to the customer containment area on site.  We formulated a game plan with the shipper to transfer it in to a new trailer.  We also brought in a response team to 'diaper' the trailer in the interim to help contain it.  The transload was successful and the trailer stopped leaking and was cleaned and put on the train back to Chicago.,The trailer just arrived in Chicago this week.  It has not been inspected yet but we are confident this will be a barrel leak.  I do not anticipate that the leak is due to corrosion.  I suspect this is due to a crack in a specific spot where the barrel recieves the most impact pressure when they are lifted on and off the train.  There is a reinforcement kit that will be installed when / if that is the case.  I will update this form once we have confirmation on the root cause - corrective actions.,No,TANK,Portable tank,TANK PRT,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"SCHNEIDER NATIONAL BULK CARRIERS, INC.",US,

The rail car was isolated and the shipper, GEOCYCLE, was notified via the waybill’s emergency contact number (877-818-0087).  MEI, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the car was releasing product vapor due to a faulty vacuum relief valve (VRV). Contractor personnel removed the faulty VRV and installed a pipe plug to stop the release. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper’s representative- Marvin Sparks (843-826-1746, marvin.sparks@geocycle.com). The car was held at this location pending further repair and qualification by a certified mobile repair unit or receipt of One Time Move Approval from the FRA.",No comments provided,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CSX CORPORATION,US,

The employee notified the Yard Coordinator who in turn made internal emergency notifications per the CN ERP. The tank car was set out to an isolation track (WA90) for inspection by the CN Dangerous Goods Officer. A CN Dangerous Goods Officer responding to the incident. It was immediately noted upon the initial visual inspection that the BOV handle was in the ""engaged"" position and the BOV handle was not pinned. It was also noted that there was wetness around the threads of the BOV cap with wetness on the ballast directly below. An Ethanol type odor was also present. The BOV cap was found to be less than tool tight (could turn by hand) allowing any product collecting within the cap to leak out. Several attempts were made to dis-engage the BOV handle from the valve so it could be pinned in the closed position. These attempts were un-successful. The BOV cap was then removed to determine if the BOV was still leaking as the tank car did not drip any liquids during the DGO's inspection and attempts to dis-engage the BOV handle from the valve. Although there was standing liquid within the BOV cap, the valve itself did not leak after a 20 minute observation. The cap was then re-installed tool tight. A cable seal was utilized to secure the BOV handle in the closed (9 O'clock) position so that it may not open during transit. Home Shop decals were applied to both sides of the tank car, the BOV was red tagged (do not operate). Both the shipper and consignee were notified of the incident and were advised the tank car will require an FRA OTMA 1 prior to being released.",,No,TANK CAR,,117R100W,Yes,,,,ZZ,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,17271,GTW,US,

Upon approaching the railcar, liquid was observed streaming down the sides of the railcar and pooling on the ground below the railcar. Under closer inspection, liquid was observed coming from the liquid eduction line. Attempts were made to tighten the cap and were unsuccessful. The pressure was relieved which stopped the leak. The liquid eduction cap was again attempted to be tightened again; 7 additional turns were achieved. The cap was removed to check if a gasket was installed. No gasket was observed. A gasket was installed in the liquid eduction cap and teflon tape was applied to the threads. The liquid eduction cap was properly installed. The exterior of the railcar was decontaminated.

The forks of the lift were extending approximately 3-4 inches beyond the underneath of the IBC and while repositioning the tote the fork made contact with another tote behind it, resulting in a ~3"" gash at the bottom corner of the container. The tote began leaking rapidly and spilled ~150 gallons within a 10 minute span. The material flooded the back of the box van and the surrounding concrete of the dock area. The Veolia team quickly began blocking off the storm drain located in the dock area with spill pads and oil dry, as well as blocking off the back of the trailer to slow the pace of the material leaking out the trailer. The spill was promptly cleaned up and absorbent material was containerized. The remaining material in the damaged tote was transferred into a new container.","Additional training on tote-specific handling with a forklift will help prevent any further incidents.

There was also noted wetness on the other inner package box. And it had been tapped over. Wet outer packaging was placed in a beg.

(WFS) tanker truck and driver were dispatched to the American Heritage vessel located at the Public Landing in downtown Cincinnati, OH for a delivery. The WFS driver arrived on site around 0830 and completed site inspection with vessel personnel, then begin the delivery. At approximately, 0900 the WFS driver saw product leaking from the truck’s pumping equipment and immediately hit the emergency shut off stopping product flow. Five gallons of No. 2 diesel fuel spilled from piping where a gasket had ruptured between the truck’s meter and pump. The spill impacted the concrete parking lot and up to a gallon of diesel impacted the Ohio River at mile marker 469.9. Both WFS and the vessel personnel took action to contained and the cleaned up the spill. The vessel deployed a boom and WFS used spill pads to contained the spill. The WFS driver notified the Cincinnati Operations Manager who then notified the HSSE Manager at 0930. Additional WFS personnel and the Operations Manager were deployed to site with spill cleaned up supplies at this time. And, HEPACO, WFS OSRO, was notified and dispatched to the site. WFS notified the NRC at 0955 of the incident. The Ohio EPA and the Hamilton EMA were notified of the spill between 1008 and 1015. By 1100 the spill had been cleaned up. The spill was cleaned up using absorbent booms, oil dry, and spills pads. Both WFS and vessel personnel cleaned up the spill and HEPACO was called off. The tanker unit was placed out of service until repairs could be completed. WFS later completed the delivery with different equipment, demobilize, and left the site.","World Fuel Service, Inc. (WFS) reviews and investigates all incidents to determine root cause and what corrective actions need to be implemented to prevent any reoccurrences. The spill occurred because of an equipment failure. A gasket in the piping between the truck’s meter and pump ruptured. This resulted in a five gallon spill. The unit was taken out of service until it was repaired. And, new WFS tanker trucks will be outfitted with United States Coast Guard certified hoses so that newer tanker trucks can be used for future deliveries to these type of locations. These units will be added to the facility response plan. And, these units will be outfitted with additional spill supplies and a new procedure will be implemented to place a precautionary absorbent boom down between the tanker truck and vessel for future over the water deliveries. During the September Operations Safety Meetings, all drivers will be brief on the incident and reminded on the importance of never leaving the point of discharge while product is flowing.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"World Fuel Services, Inc.",US,

He was utilizing a forklift in which he was approaching 4 drums that were palletized. The employee did not realize that the pallet was not a standard size pallet and was not as deep. The forks exceeded the length of the pallet and hit the drum that was on the opposing side. The forks hit the drum roughly an inch above the bottom chime resulting in the drum getting damaged and a small pinhole leak occurred. The overall duration of the incident was a less than 10 minutes and it was determined that approximately 4 to 5 cups of material leaked out. The Veolia employees on site were able to contain the spill and place the damaged drum into a salvage drum.","The Veolia employee was immediately removed from all forklift operations and was retrained and re-evaluated.  The employee was trained to observe for difference in pallet sizes along with making sure he gets off the forklift to make accurate determination of the length of the forks in comparison to the pallet.

The leak occurred when the employee was moving the drums into the trailer and the employee misjudged the clearance to another drum. The 55 gallon drum containing flammable corrosive liquids was scraped with a drum cart which resulted in causing a leak from the drum. Approximately one pint of liquid leaked out of the impacted drum. Liquid was only observed on trailer right below drum and did not leak out of the vehicle.   The drum was overpacked into an 85 gallon salvage drum, the spill cleaned up, and transportation to the ultimate disposal facility was continued. The liquid was cleaned up with spill pads and absorbent material. The duration of release is anticipated to be less than 1 minute as the employee immediately noticed the accident and began taking measures to contain the spill.",On 8/02/2023 the Veolia safety manager was notified of the spill. The results of the investigation revealed that the employee misjudged the distance from the drum cart to the nearby drum that was hit. The hole was on the bottom of the drum and was from scraping the side of the drum. The employee was instructed to be more careful maneuvering the drum cart.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

Driver continued to try to get control of the rig and dragged the pup for approximately 1/4 mile, spilling fuel the whole way, until the equipment came to a stop on the westbound lane. Upon inspection of the crash site the driver observed several spot fires so he grabbed his 20# extinguisher and attempted to put them out, Shortly after stopping he observed that the tank was on fire so he unhooked his main from the pup and moved the truck down the road. The pup became engulfed in flames and was a total loss as well as the 3500 gal of Diesel fuel.

They prepped an empty tote in the event there was a need to transfer the material out of the tote. Once they were all prepped, they checked the valve handle to make sure it was fully in the closed position. When the outlet cap was unscrewed, the material shot out of the valve due to a missing ball valve. Over half of the material was captured in the second tote and approximately 125 gals of the material released to the asphalt around the load dock. There was no release to the environment. The yard team quickly controlled the release with berms, absorbents, and vermiculite/floor dry and proceeded to clean up the material.","Ingenium provided the client with the reconditioned tote.

A valve on the customers tank was left open and the product was flowing into the overflow drum which had a crack in the bottom of it. The driver then shut off his valves from the truck to stop the unloading process to allow customer to close the valve. The product was flowing out of the cracked drum onto a concrete pad for 5 minutes. The customer took responsibility for the release and replaced the cracked drum to ensure there would not be a release in the future if the overflow tank would be utilized. The product was used in the cleaning process of the concrete pad where it was spilled.,The customer aknowleded a procedural error in not closing all the valves before the unloading process begun. PVS Minibulk discussed this incident at our monthly safety meeting on the importance of checking all valves and monitoring the entire line during the unloading process. We discussed with the customer the importance of double checking all valves before the unloading process begins and checking the integrity of the overflow drum periodically to ensure there are no leaks.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"PVS TRANSPORTATION, INC.",US,

They prepped an empty tote in the event there was a need to transfer the material out of the tote. Once they were all prepped, they checked the valve handle to make sure it was fully in the closed position. When the outlet cap was unscrewed, the material shot out of the valve due to a missing ball valve. Over half of the material was captured in the second tote and approximately 125 gals of the material released to the asphalt around the load dock. There was no release to the environment. The yard team quickly controlled the release with berms, absorbents, and vermiculite/floor dry and proceeded to clean up the material.","Ingenium provided the client with the reconditioned tote.

Box 202,BRAZIL,IN,47834-6814,Carrier,"Approximately 8:00 am on August 10, 2023, our driver stated that he noticed a transmission light on his dash, and he felt the trailer dragging. he then heard a loud pup while driving EB on US highway 6, thinking he blew a tire. He did not see any debris as he looked to his rear view mirror, and he stated the traffic was very heavy with no shoulder to safely pull off the road on a 2 lane road. So he proceeded to the nearest safe haven so he could inspect the problem. He approached the Fuel Mart on Hwy 6 and US 23, and pulled off of the road. As he walked to the rear of the trailer to inspect the incident, he found it to be on fire around the back axle and tires. He proceeded to get the fire extinguisher from his truck, but was unable to extinguish the fire. Another bystander had already called 911, so he disconnected his truck from the trailer.  To the best of our knowledge, we believe that while he was driving, he either blew a brake chamber, or had an air leak causing the axle to drag. Which subsequently caused the tires to drag, and initiate the transmission light on his dash. Followed by the tire to blow out and getting hot enough to spark a fire burning the tires. By the time the Fire Department arrived the fire was hot enough to burn a hole through the back side wall of the aluminum trailer.","After meeting with our driver and taking his statement on the incident, Our conclusion of the incident is, the driver needed to stop as soon as possible after he noticed the transmission light, and hearing what he thought was a tire blowing out. Our recommendation to him was to stop as soon as possible. With the heavy traffic and a small shoulder that he did not feel safe to pull over on, he should possibly call 911 for assistance to help him get off of the 2 lane highway and help control traffic which was very heavy at that particular time.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,320000,BRAZIL TRUCKING INC,US,

Stopped for diesel fuel in MS and no defects were noted prior to leaving the gas station. Jerry noted that traffic was moderate with some construction zones that caused him to use his brakes more often.   At approx. 1:00pm CST Jerry was passing a car in the left lane at 70 mph. and noticed smoke coming from under the rear portion of the trailer. Heard a loud bang and pulled to the right side of the road as soon as he was able.   Jerry grabbed the fire extinguisher and noticed flames coming from the passenger side of the tractor below the 5th wheel - he emptied the extinguisher out and ran when unable to control. He called 911 at this time.   The flames from the tractor engulfed the trailer and caused pressure relief valves to discharge propane and the propane ignited spreading to all 1344 cylinders being affected.   Traffic was stopped in the Northbound lanes and first responders arrived within 10 min. and immediately secured the scene. The fire and release lasted about 30 min. to an hour while local first responders ensured the flames didn't spread.

The Environmental& Hazmat Department mobilized a railroad qualified response contractor to mitigate the release. Upon arrival, responders found one of the four bolts securing the liquid line four bolt blind flange primary closure not tool tight Responders vented the rail car to stop the release and tightened the four bolt flange bolt tool tight, approximately 3 full turns. Responders also found one of the nuts used to secure the all-thread bolt on the bottom spool of the liquid line was not tool tight against the spool flange. This nut could not be secured tool tight The nut was removed and replaced with another nut that was rendered tool tight to the spool flange for proper securement The removed nut was found to be rusted and had stripped threads. Atmospheric temperature was thought to have caused sufficient thermal expansion to push liquid up the liquid line and by the loose four bolt blind flange closure and/or the spool. The defective all-thread bolt on the spool was located directly below the nut that was tool tightened on the blind flange. UTLX 130533 was monitored for an additional 20 minutes to ensure that the leak had been secured, with no leaks detected. Rendering both nuts tool tight stopped the leak. The estimated release Is 1 gallon. The released commodity on the car was neutralized. Once the release was mitlgated, the car was returned to transportation.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Maryland Department of the Environment, and National Response Center were notified.  (CHEMTREC Report #2023-0831-00068). The local fire department responded to the site and observed the A-End liquid valve partially open and secondary closure plug less than tool tight, and actively releasing lading. Specialized Professional Services, Inc., a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and confirmed a partially open liquid valve and less than tool tight secondary closure plug. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper, Mr. Jeff Dean of Tri Gas and Oil, phone 410-310-6354. Contractor personnel closed the valve and properly installed the secondary closure plug, thus securing the release. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport.

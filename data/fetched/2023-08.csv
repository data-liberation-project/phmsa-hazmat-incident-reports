Driver moved to the customer scale on site and noticed the turpentine smell and then saw a leak coming from the bottom forward section of the insulation through a weep hole.  Driver moved it to the customer containment area on site.  We formulated a game plan with the shipper to transfer it in to a new trailer.  We also brought in a response team to 'diaper' the trailer in the interim to help contain it.  The transload was successful and the trailer stopped leaking and was cleaned and put on the train back to Chicago.,The trailer just arrived in Chicago this week.  It has not been inspected yet but we are confident this will be a barrel leak.  I do not anticipate that the leak is due to corrosion.  I suspect this is due to a crack in a specific spot where the barrel recieves the most impact pressure when they are lifted on and off the train.  There is a reinforcement kit that will be installed when / if that is the case.  I will update this form once we have confirmation on the root cause - corrective actions.,No,TANK,Portable tank,TANK PRT,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"SCHNEIDER NATIONAL BULK CARRIERS, INC.",US,

The rail car was isolated and the shipper, GEOCYCLE, was notified via the waybill’s emergency contact number (877-818-0087).  MEI, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the car was releasing product vapor due to a faulty vacuum relief valve (VRV). Contractor personnel removed the faulty VRV and installed a pipe plug to stop the release. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper’s representative- Marvin Sparks (843-826-1746, marvin.sparks@geocycle.com). The car was held at this location pending further repair and qualification by a certified mobile repair unit or receipt of One Time Move Approval from the FRA.",No comments provided,No,,,,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC.",US,

The forks of the lift were extending approximately 3-4 inches beyond the underneath of the IBC and while repositioning the tote the fork made contact with another tote behind it, resulting in a ~3"" gash at the bottom corner of the container. The tote began leaking rapidly and spilled ~150 gallons within a 10 minute span. The material flooded the back of the box van and the surrounding concrete of the dock area. The Veolia team quickly began blocking off the storm drain located in the dock area with spill pads and oil dry, as well as blocking off the back of the trailer to slow the pace of the material leaking out the trailer. The spill was promptly cleaned up and absorbent material was containerized. The remaining material in the damaged tote was transferred into a new container.","Additional training on tote-specific handling with a forklift will help prevent any further incidents.

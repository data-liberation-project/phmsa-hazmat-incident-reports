Driver moved to the customer scale on site and noticed the turpentine smell and then saw a leak coming from the bottom forward section of the insulation through a weep hole.  Driver moved it to the customer containment area on site.  We formulated a game plan with the shipper to transfer it in to a new trailer.  We also brought in a response team to 'diaper' the trailer in the interim to help contain it.  The transload was successful and the trailer stopped leaking and was cleaned and put on the train back to Chicago.,The trailer just arrived in Chicago this week.  It has not been inspected yet but we are confident this will be a barrel leak.  I do not anticipate that the leak is due to corrosion.  I suspect this is due to a crack in a specific spot where the barrel recieves the most impact pressure when they are lifted on and off the train.  There is a reinforcement kit that will be installed when / if that is the case.  I will update this form once we have confirmation on the root cause - corrective actions.,No,TANK,Portable tank,TANK PRT,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"SCHNEIDER NATIONAL BULK CARRIERS, INC.",US,

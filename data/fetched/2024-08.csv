They notified the WLE Gambrinus Yardmaster who then contacted myself, John Vergis, Hazardous Materials Officer for the WLE.  When I arrived, I could her the car leaking vapor from on top the car.  The leak was substantial, but just vapor, no liquid. I climbed the car and removed seal # 0672272 from the protective housing lid.  I investigated and found no leak inside the protective housing.  Upon further investigation, it was concluded that the leak was coming from the gasket connection between the pressure plate and the tank car nozzle.  The pressure plate stud bolts appeared to be tight.  There was no way to stop the leak.  The leak was coming from the left side of the housing.   I called CHEMTREC at 0127 hrs. to make a report and have them contact Marathon Petroleum in order to give me assistance.  Jennifer Johnson, the emergency contact from Marathon called me at 0158 to inquire about the report.  The CHEMTREC Report number was 2024080100010.  I told her what was going on and that I would be calling 911 to request the Stark County HAZMAT Team.  I also told her that I would be calling Enviroserve out of North Canton, Ohio to come out and do an emergency transfer of the car since that was the only way we could stop it from leaking.  She agreed and had me make the calls.  I called 911 at 0210 hrs.  I called the Timken Steel Security folks to have them stop all traffic on their access road that parralels the location of the incident, so that they would be no chance for ignition from any of their equipment.  I called Enviroserve at 0219 hrs. and briefed them on the situation and told them we needed and emergency transfer and then a flaring and purging of the car afterwards.   I called the Stark County Spill Report Line at 0234 hrs. to report the incident.  After we got the HAZMAT Team out and started doing air monitoring, I called to make a report with the Ohio EPA at 0505 just as a courtesy to report the vapor release.  We had 7 area rays set up for air monitoring and discovered that the vapors were going straight up and not really concentrating around the car or anywhere else at ground level.  No evacuations were required since the yard itself is isolated.  We started to Transload the car at about 0800 hrs.  We started to flare the car of its residual vapors at about 1430 hrs. and finished at 2230 hrs.  The car was labeled with Do Not Load and Home Shop Stickers and was stenciled “Cleaned”.",Not opinions of this release.,No,,,,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway,US,

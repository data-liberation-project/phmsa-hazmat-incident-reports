The car was isolated and the shipper, Marathon Petroleum Company, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report #2024082200196).

The damaged gasket was removed, a new gasket was installed, and the manway was secured for transportation.  The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper’s representative (Jennifer Johnson 209-986-1196).

The CN Dangerous Goods Team was notified and responded to the area to investigate.  An assessment of tank car # TAEX 1856 (Residue/UN 1136/Class 3) revealed a vapor release from the pressure relief device which was detected audibly and by the use of a combustible gas detector along with a leak detecting solution. A pressure test was performed via the vapor valve which revealed the tank car to have an internal pressure of 5 psi. The low pressure indicated the pressure relief device was faulty and not performing as intended, allowing vapors to escape.  The tank car was moved to an isolation track where the remaining internal pressure was vented through a scrubbing media which stopped the leak.

The puncture was caused by an unnoticed metal burr on the drum cart. The release duration was less than one minute resulting in approximately 1 liter of liquid leaked onto the trailer floor. The spill was cleaned using spill pads and absorbent material and the damaged drum was overpacked into an 85-gallon salvage drum for continued transportation to the disposal facility.","The Veolia safety manager was notified of the spill on 8/7/24 and performed an investigation into the incident. The investigation found the employee was unaware of the defect with the drum cart. Following the incident, the employee inspected the drum cart and identified the burr that pierced the drum. The drum cart was placed out of service.   Corrective Actions: 1. Inspect and maintain drum handling equipment regularly. 2. Reinforce proper drum handling procedures with employees. 3.

Upon closer examination, it was discovered that one of the drums on the pallet had sustained a minor gash near its base. The leak was estimated to be approximately half an ounce of liquid. The spill was immediately addressed using oil-dry absorbent material, and the damaged drum was safely transferred into an overpack container to prevent further leakage.","The exact cause and timing of the damage to the drum remain uncertain. However, this incident serves as a reminder of the importance of implementing rigorous inspection protocols for all containers. It also emphasizes the need for exercising extreme caution when handling and moving any type of container. Regular and thorough inspections, combined with careful handling practices, can significantly reduce the risk of similar incidents in the future and ensure safer operations overall.",No,                             ,,,No,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

She stood up and realized the phone may have been crunched/damaged in the jumpseat. She noticed a crack in the device's screen.  A few moments later she noticed the phone began to feel warm. She notified the FWD flight attendant of the issue. Together, they took the device to a galley ice tray and drowned the device in ice water and notified the flight deck. At that point, they realized they should be using the aircraft's fire containment bag. They moved the device to the fire containment bag and added more liquid to completely drown the device. Upon arrival into ORD, the fire containment bag containing the damaged device was handed off to a customer service agent. There were no further issues with the damaged device. PLEASE NOTE that the device DID NOT emit smoke, sparks, flames, or any gasses.

Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 110-gallons of product released to a 53' x 8' area of the trailer floor, 54' x 8' area of the asphalt roadway, a 54' x 2.5' area of the soil shoulder, and a 30' x 40' area of the customer’s asphalt lot as well as into a storm drain catch basin. Contractors secured the release with absorbents, pads, and boom upon arrival. The crew confirmed the tote was punctured due to improper loading. The material still in the damaged tote was transferred into a new one. Once all free liquid was absorbed, sodium bicarbonate and water were used to rinse the impacted areas to clean and neutralize them. The following day, the crew returned to site with a vac truck and a pressure washer. The impacted catch basin was vacuumed and flushed out. The customer confirmed the pumps were shut off so the material could not migrate from the drains catch basin. The impacted concrete lot at the customers location and the impacted asphalt roadway were then pressure washed, and all material was collected into a vac-truck. Approximately 1300-gallons of impacted wastewater were removed from site pending disposal. (5) 55-gallon poly drums of impacted absorbents, the cut up damaged poly tote, and impacted debris were transported to the XPO Terminal located in Jonesboro, AR for terminal personnel to manage.

The employee notified the Waterloo Yard Master who in turn notified the CN Dangerous Goods Team. The tank car was set out to an isolation track (WA60) for inspection by a CN emergency response contractor.  A CN emergency response contractor was dispatched to the location for mitigation. The contractor performed an inspection of the tank car and found the bottom outlet valve to be leaking from the threads of the bottom outlet valve cap. It was determined that there was a failure in the sealing surface of the valve seat to include a defective gasket. (The BOV cap was found to be less than tool tight and the BOV in the closed position and pinned upon initial inspection). CN emergency response contractor did observe cable seal to be correctly in place. The BOV cap was removed, and it was observed to be leaking past the closed ball.  The BOV valve handle was cycled several times to the open and closed position to free any debris that may have been trapped in the BOV sealing surface potentially causing the leak. The BOV cap was then removed and observed for 20 minutes to ensure there was no further leakage from the valve. It was noted that the BOV cap gasket was deformed and was replaced. The bottom outlet valve cap was then re-installed and tightened with a 36"" pipe wrench. Upon tightening the BOV cap, CN emergency response contractor proceeded to place new cable seals on the BOV / Cap.",No comments provided.,No,TANK CAR,,117J100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,17910,CCP,US,

Update from the driver advised a small 80-gallon pool with product is filled and a second pool was being used to collect product, but the leak was steady.  Clean Harbors arrived on site and advised an estimated 70-gallons were released and caught in the retention pits due to a internal valve leaking. The released product was collected and placed into a 275-gal tote. A vac truck was used to transfer the remainder of product from the tank.  The transfer has been completed. The impacted plastics used for retention were cut and drummed.

As the drum, weighing over 600 pounds, was being positioned onto a pallet inside the Veolia box truck, a leak was detected. To prevent the drum from slipping and potentially injuring personnel, it was promptly secured on the pallet. However, approximately one gallon of the waste material escaped from the drum, contaminating both the pallet and the box truck's floor.  The cause of the leak remains unclear, as the drum's position did not seem to be a contributing factor. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the inner container was missing its bung, which may have played a role in the unexpected release of the waste material.","Following the incident, management reinforced safety protocols by instructing all employees to thoroughly inspect and confirm the secure closure of all containers before initiating any transport or relocation procedures.",No,                             ,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

At the tow facility there was an additional release of material that impacted a trail of concrete and the inside of a roll-off. Contractors neutralized, and cleaned all impacted areas with absorbents, then transferred the remaining product from the damaged totes into new totes.

The release impacted the trailer floor, the pallet, and a second carton. ERTS reviewed the SDS and determined that a contractor is necessary due to the corrosivity (Class 8). ERTS dispatched a contractor to perform cleanup activities.  Contractors arrived on site and confirmed approximately 1 ounce of product released to 2'x2' area of the trailer floor due to improper loading.  Contractors deployed absorbents and sodium bicarb solution to the impacted area to clean and neutralize the release.

Upon further inspection it is revealed that the drum had a loose lid/ seal failure leading to the spill, we believed it to be non hazardous at first. We had to reach out to the shipper to get the SDS which caused the initial delay in the DPR, however when provided the transport section did not have any information about it being hazardous, but we suspected it being hazardous because of the SDS chemical composition as well as the GHS classifications listed. We processed the DPR and ISF and asked for an updated SDS from the shipper and the delay from then to filling out an incident report was because the shipper sent us an SDS with the transport information today, however the SDS itself seems to have some conflicting items as it is classified as non hazardous but a UN#, class, as well as packing group were provided right below , it also has acute toxicity NFPA label and a skull and crossbones GHS label but no other information in the transport section about them.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Vertex Energy, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report #2024081700082). Hulls Environmental, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to inspect the car.  Response personnel confirmed asphalt adhering to side and top of tank car, additionally it was noted that product had released due to an improperly secured manway cover. Specifically, 4 of the 8 manway cover swing bolts not applied; 4 of the 8 manway cover swing bolts were less than tool tight; and the manway cover gasket wis aligned.  Contractor personnel inspected and reinstalled the gasket, and properly secured the manway cover for transportation.  All hazardous product adhering to the exterior of the tank was removed.

CN Mechanical Supervisor notified CN Dangerous Goods Officer (DGO) Vaughan and CN Police.  CN Dangerous Goods Officer (DGO) Vaughan performed an inspection of the tank car and found the liquid line cap to be #less than tool tight# and easily manipulated by hand, was actively leaking from the threads onto the tank car and to the ground. Additionally, the air valve plug was found #less than tool tight# and could be manipulated by hand. The air valve was in the fully closed position.  The CN Dangerous Goods Officer (DGO) responded to the site and slowly vented through the air valve to depressurize the tank car. The DGO applied new Teflon tape and tightened the liquid eduction line cap tool tight using a 24# pipe wrench. New Teflon was applied to the air valve plug and properly installed and tightened #tool tight# using a 24# pipe wrench. A CN contractor responded to decontaminate the tank car and the ground.

A Veolia employee was reorganizing the box truck when the accident happened. While using a drum cart to relocate the Isopropanol container, the drum was improperly secured and fell backwards onto the cart. As a result, one of the cart's forks punctured the drum.  The puncture caused approximately 2 gallons of Isopropanol to spill. Prompt action was taken to address the situation. The spilled material was thoroughly cleaned up and disposed of in accordance with proper procedures. To prevent further leakage, the damaged drum was placed inside an overpack container.","This incident highlights the importance of proper drum handling and securement techniques during transportation and storage operations.   Following the incident, a safety briefing was conducted with all Veolia field service personnel. The briefing emphasized two key points:  1) The importance of regularly inspecting and maintaining material handling equipment to ensure it is in proper working condition; and   2) The critical need to securely fasten all packages, containers, and drums during any movement or transportation.  This reminder aimed to reinforce best practices in handling hazardous materials and prevent similar incidents in the future. Management stressed that these safety protocols are essential for protecting employees, customers, and the environment from potential hazards associated with chemical spills or leaks.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The drum was contained on a pallet on the trailer floor, but appeared to be slightly leaning. An employee attempted to carefully move the drum to a position where it could be managed and depressurized. While re-positioning, the base of the drum split away from the bottom chime, and caused approximately 45 gallons of waste flammable liquids to release onto the trailer floor, secondary containment beneath the trailer, and the receiving dock. The two employees immediately went inside of the office building and contacted Veolia's Emergency Coordinator to report the spill at 22:55 MST. The Emergency Coordinator arrived onsite at 23:30 MST and verified the released material as UN1993 Waste Flammable Liquids at 00:06 MST. A D001 reportable quantity of 100 lbs triggered a report of the incident to the NRC. The NRC report began at 00:17 MST (NRC Report Number 1408646). The spill was also reported to the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment (CDPHE) using the online environmental spill release report form, submitted at 00:36 MST. Veolia personnel conducted in house cleanup of the released material using absorbent material, and then pressure washed the area. No injuries or exposures occurred.","To prevent recurrence, Veolia reviewed the requirements to complete a thorough container inspection prior to moving a container, and the expectations of the procedure to follow when employees discover a pressurized container.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The package was then placed into a line bin & brought to QA for processing.  Upon inspecting the packages exterior, the shipping label had a ""No-Air"" marking underneath the ground symbol, & and a slip that contained a Safety Data Sheet for the contents inside was found on one side of the box.  It was also discovered that the package did not have any Hazmat/Hazmat paperwork &/or Limited Quantity markings on the package which raised some concerns.  Upon opening the package 4 1-gallon cans of Seal For Life Industries Temper Kote 1000 41 Silver Industrial Heat Coating were found soiled & with the lids popped off causing them to leak contents.  3 out of 4 were also badly bent/dented & crushed on several areas of the can.  None of the 4 cans had paint clips to help prevent the lids from popping off & no packing material was inside the package to protect the cans exteriors. According to Spidr image the package appeared to be unharmed when viewing overhead images of the package at MIDD hub, meaning the package may have loaded improperly & damaged in transit as a result.  When referencing Section 14 under DOT classification in the Safety Data Sheet it was discovered the contents are classified as Packing Group 2 & as a Class 3 Flammable Liquid.  Several packages were leaked on as a result of the spill but were able to be successfully repacked.  The portion of the leftover cardboard from the repacks were held at the QA cage to be placed into the line salvage drum per cleanup.  The Improper Shipping Form & Damaged Package Report were filled out.  Contents & cardboard were placed into a line salvage drum & sealed.

Truck tracked off right side of road onto soft shoulder comprised of sand and gravel. Driver over-corrected and slowed which caused. trailer to jack-knife and overturn onto roadway. Impact of trailer to roadway and abrasion from dragging along road caused two compartments of trailer to be breached. Trailer terminated across both lanes of highway. Trailer sustained damage to rear and center compartments. Rear compartment was damaged due to impact that caused a greater than 12-inch crack along the outer trailer wall and internal vertical wall between rear and center compartment. Center compartment sustained multiple pittings and an approximate 4-inch vertical crack on the side that abraded along roadway (See attached pictures). Absorbent materials consisting of pads, booms and granular matter was dispensed immediately. Emergency response and spill response crews were notified and cleanup activities began immediately by pumping out remaining contents of trailer and removing trailer from roadway along with cleanup of roadway and visible fuel. Soil excavation activities began on August 5, 2024 upon receipt of encroachment permit from Idaho Department of Transportation.","A root cause analysis was performed after the incident.

Package was isolated into a red tote and removed to the station HAZMAT cage to begin damaged package process for HAZMATs. Further inspection of the package interior verified that one out of four bottles of sulfuric acid had a loosened safety cap, resulting in the gradual spill of its contents inside the package, which remained mostly contained inside the package.

They notified the WLE Gambrinus Yardmaster who then contacted myself, John Vergis, Hazardous Materials Officer for the WLE.  When I arrived, I could her the car leaking vapor from on top the car.  The leak was substantial, but just vapor, no liquid. I climbed the car and removed seal # 0672272 from the protective housing lid.  I investigated and found no leak inside the protective housing.  Upon further investigation, it was concluded that the leak was coming from the gasket connection between the pressure plate and the tank car nozzle.  The pressure plate stud bolts appeared to be tight.  There was no way to stop the leak.  The leak was coming from the left side of the housing.   I called CHEMTREC at 0127 hrs. to make a report and have them contact Marathon Petroleum in order to give me assistance.  Jennifer Johnson, the emergency contact from Marathon called me at 0158 to inquire about the report.  The CHEMTREC Report number was 2024080100010.  I told her what was going on and that I would be calling 911 to request the Stark County HAZMAT Team.  I also told her that I would be calling Enviroserve out of North Canton, Ohio to come out and do an emergency transfer of the car since that was the only way we could stop it from leaking.  She agreed and had me make the calls.  I called 911 at 0210 hrs.  I called the Timken Steel Security folks to have them stop all traffic on their access road that parralels the location of the incident, so that they would be no chance for ignition from any of their equipment.  I called Enviroserve at 0219 hrs. and briefed them on the situation and told them we needed and emergency transfer and then a flaring and purging of the car afterwards.   I called the Stark County Spill Report Line at 0234 hrs. to report the incident.  After we got the HAZMAT Team out and started doing air monitoring, I called to make a report with the Ohio EPA at 0505 just as a courtesy to report the vapor release.  We had 7 area rays set up for air monitoring and discovered that the vapors were going straight up and not really concentrating around the car or anywhere else at ground level.  No evacuations were required since the yard itself is isolated.  We started to Transload the car at about 0800 hrs.  We started to flare the car of its residual vapors at about 1430 hrs. and finished at 2230 hrs.  The car was labeled with Do Not Load and Home Shop Stickers and was stenciled “Cleaned”.",Not opinions of this release.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway,US,

The package was then placed into a line bin & brought to QA for processing.  Upon inspecting the packages exterior, the shipping label had a ""No-Air"" marking underneath the ground symbol, & and a slip that contained a Safety Data Sheet for the contents inside was found on one side of the box.  It was also discovered that the package did not have any Hazmat/Hazmat paperwork &/or Limited Quantity markings on the package which raised some concerns.  Upon opening the package 4 1-gallon cans of Seal For Life Industries Temper Kote 1000 41 Silver Industrial Heat Coating were found soiled & with the lids popped off causing them to leak contents.  3 out of 4 were also badly bent/dented & crushed on several areas of the can.  None of the 4 cans had paint clips to help prevent the lids from popping off & no packing material was inside the package to protect the cans exteriors. According to Spidr image the package appeared to be unharmed when viewing overhead images of the package at MIDD hub, meaning the package may have loaded improperly & damaged in transit as a result.  When referencing Section 14 under DOT classification in the Safety Data Sheet it was discovered the contents are classified as Packing Group 2 & as a Class 3 Flammable Liquid.  Several packages were leaked on as a result of the spill but were able to be successfully repacked.  The portion of the leftover cardboard from the repacks were held at the QA cage to be placed into the line salvage drum per cleanup.  The Improper Shipping Form & Damaged Package Report were filled out.  Contents & cardboard were placed into a line salvage drum & sealed.

Source of leak found to be small round hole underneath drum; shape of hole was not conducive to damage from the used handling equipment, edges of hole were not pressed inward and not conducive to indication of a puncture, inner rim of the drum's bottom side displayed signs of wear as though metal was aged despite a newer layer of paint. Determined that bottom face had been painted over a weakened surface of the container and that the contents of the drum could have contributed to breaking through paint and an already degraded structural material.",Inspected inventory of new and reconditioned drums to determine if other drums displayed similar indications of inadequate quality; none found.  Inform Reconditoner of event and findings so that they can be aware of observed discrepancy with container condition and with a potential gap within their reconditioning process or with the quality of containers they source before beginning the reconditioning process.

A safety briefing was held prior to any assessment or cleanup activities began.  Two field staff suited up in level B PPE to make and initial assessment of the spill. During the initial incident assessment, the semi truck was observed to have overturned onto its side on the Hwy 52 Northbound ramp. The totes and drums within the trailer were flipped from their original position and were sitting with the openings resting on the roof of the trailer. The contents of some of the containers were observed to be still leaking onto the trailer and running out into the vegetation within the right of the way. A large plume of vapor was observed exiting a hole within the roof of the trailer due to a reaction from the chemicals. (It is believed that the vapor was from the non-hazmat products). Entry into the trailer was made to collect PH sample from the products on the floor, assess damage to the containers, and take an inventory of the contents.  Due to the products still gassing, causing a plume of vapor, a confined space fan was set up to vent out the trailer while staff were working. After the initial assessment was conducted, a cleanup plan was made to pump out and transfer the container into new totes. Field Staff began setting up and prepares to transfer the remaining product from the containers. Two staff made entry into the trailer and began to make openings into the hydrogen peroxide totes so a stinger pipe could be used to reach the bottom. Once all of the hydrogen peroxide totes were transferred, 55 gallons of water were flushed through the hoses and pump to decontaminate it before moving onto the next product. After the flush, field staff continued the same process to the remaining products within the trailer until all the totes were empty.  A second crew arrived on site to relieve the initial response crew. A safety briefing  was conducted along with a discussion about the remaining work prior to the first crew mobilizing off site. The second crew began with recovering and overpacking the remaining drums within the trailer. Four drums were still intact, three of the drums were observed to be compromised and damaged, and one drum was empty. The three compromised drums were overpacked and prepared for transport.

At some point during this action, her Electronic Flight Attendant Device (iPhone 12) slid from her pocket and into the gap behind the folding jumpseat. She stood up and realized the phone may have been crunched/damaged in the jumpseat. She noticed a crack in the device's screen.  A few moments later she noticed the phone began to feel warm. She notified the FWD flight attendant of the issue. Together, they took the device to a galley ice tray and drowned the device in ice water and notified the flight deck. At that point, they realized they should be using the aircraft's fire containment bag. They moved the device to the fire containment bag and added more liquid to completely drown the device. Upon arrival into ORD, the fire containment bag containing the damaged device was handed off to a customer service agent. There were no further issues with the damaged device.

The employee notified the Waterloo Yard Master who in turn notified the CN Dangerous Goods Team. The tank car was set out to an isolation track (WA60) for inspection by a CN emergency response contractor.  A CN emergency response contractor was dispatched to the location for mitigation. The contractor performed an inspection of the tank car and found the bottom outlet valve to be leaking from the threads of the bottom outlet valve cap. It was determined that there was a failure in the sealing surface of the valve seat to include a defective gasket. (The BOV cap was found to be less than tool tight and the BOV in the closed position and pinned upon initial inspection). CN emergency response contractor did observe cable seal to be correctly in place. The BOV cap was removed, and it was observed to be leaking past the closed ball.  The BOV valve handle was cycled several times to the open and closed position to free any debris that may have been trapped in the BOV sealing surface potentially causing the leak. The BOV cap was then removed and observed for 20 minutes to ensure there was no further leakage from the valve. It was noted that the BOV cap gasket was deformed and was replaced.

Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of Lactic Acid (UN3265, Corrosive Liquid, acidic, organic, n.o.s., 8, III) from (9) 275-gallon IBC plastic totes. The release was caused by a rollover accident and impacted the trailer floor, and an area of soil. Contractors placed neutralizer and absorbents on the soil in preparation for remedial and restorative activities, and the totes and trailer were transported to a nearby tow facility. At the tow facility there was an additional release of material that impacted a trail of concrete and the inside of a roll-off. Contractors neutralized, and cleaned all impacted areas with absorbents, then transferred the remaining product from the damaged totes into new totes.

A Veolia employee was reorganizing the box truck when the accident happened. While using a drum cart to relocate the Isopropanol container, the drum was improperly secured and fell backwards onto the cart. As a result, one of the cart's forks punctured the drum.  The puncture caused approximately 2 gallons of Isopropanol to spill. Prompt action was taken to address the situation. The spilled material was thoroughly cleaned up and disposed of in accordance with proper procedures. To prevent further leakage, the damaged drum was placed inside an overpack container.","This incident highlights the importance of proper drum handling and securement techniques during transportation and storage operations.   Following the incident, a safety briefing was conducted with all Veolia field service personnel. The briefing emphasized two key points:  1) The importance of regularly inspecting and maintaining material handling equipment to ensure it is in proper working condition; and   2) The critical need to securely fasten all packages, containers, and drums during any movement or transportation.  This reminder aimed to reinforce best practices in handling hazardous materials and prevent similar incidents in the future. Management stressed that these safety protocols are essential for protecting employees, customers, and the environment from potential hazards associated with chemical spills or leaks.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The package was then placed into a line bin & brought to QA for processing.  Upon inspecting the packages exterior, the shipping label had a ""No-Air"" marking underneath the ground symbol, & and a slip that contained a Safety Data Sheet for the contents inside was found on one side of the box.  It was also discovered that the package did not have any Hazmat/Hazmat paperwork &/or Limited Quantity markings on the package which raised some concerns.  Upon opening the package 4 1-gallon cans of Seal For Life Industries Temper Kote 1000 41 Silver Industrial Heat Coating were found soiled & with the lids popped off causing them to leak contents.  3 out of 4 were also badly bent/dented & crushed on several areas of the can.  None of the 4 cans had paint clips to help prevent the lids from popping off & no packing material was inside the package to protect the cans exteriors. According to Spidr image the package appeared to be unharmed when viewing overhead images of the package at MIDD hub, meaning the package may have loaded improperly & damaged in transit as a result.  When referencing Section 14 under DOT classification in the Safety Data Sheet it was discovered the contents are classified as Packing Group 2 & as a Class 3 Flammable Liquid.  Several packages were leaked on as a result of the spill but were able to be successfully repacked.  The portion of the leftover cardboard from the repacks were held at the QA cage to be placed into the line salvage drum per cleanup.  The Improper Shipping Form & Damaged Package Report were filled out.  Contents & cardboard were placed into a line salvage drum & sealed.

Package was isolated into a red tote and removed to the station HAZMAT cage to begin damaged package process for HAZMATs. Further inspection of the package interior verified that one out of four bottles of sulfuric acid had a loosened safety cap, resulting in the gradual spill of its contents inside the package, which remained mostly contained inside the package. Some of the cardboard box the items came in was eaten away from the spillage. There was also little to no inner packing material inside the package securing the hazardous items; there was a little bit of bubble packaging material inside, but not enough to secure the bottles, which allowed for space inside for the items to move around inside the package during transport, which resulted in damage and spillage occurring.",n/a,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Federal Express Corporation,US,

They notified the WLE Gambrinus Yardmaster who then contacted myself, John Vergis, Hazardous Materials Officer for the WLE.  When I arrived, I could her the car leaking vapor from on top the car.  The leak was substantial, but just vapor, no liquid. I climbed the car and removed seal # 0672272 from the protective housing lid.  I investigated and found no leak inside the protective housing.  Upon further investigation, it was concluded that the leak was coming from the gasket connection between the pressure plate and the tank car nozzle.  The pressure plate stud bolts appeared to be tight.  There was no way to stop the leak.  The leak was coming from the left side of the housing.   I called CHEMTREC at 0127 hrs. to make a report and have them contact Marathon Petroleum in order to give me assistance.  Jennifer Johnson, the emergency contact from Marathon called me at 0158 to inquire about the report.  The CHEMTREC Report number was 2024080100010.  I told her what was going on and that I would be calling 911 to request the Stark County HAZMAT Team.  I also told her that I would be calling Enviroserve out of North Canton, Ohio to come out and do an emergency transfer of the car since that was the only way we could stop it from leaking.  She agreed and had me make the calls.  I called 911 at 0210 hrs.  I called the Timken Steel Security folks to have them stop all traffic on their access road that parralels the location of the incident, so that they would be no chance for ignition from any of their equipment.  I called Enviroserve at 0219 hrs. and briefed them on the situation and told them we needed and emergency transfer and then a flaring and purging of the car afterwards.   I called the Stark County Spill Report Line at 0234 hrs. to report the incident.  After we got the HAZMAT Team out and started doing air monitoring, I called to make a report with the Ohio EPA at 0505 just as a courtesy to report the vapor release.  We had 7 area rays set up for air monitoring and discovered that the vapors were going straight up and not really concentrating around the car or anywhere else at ground level.  No evacuations were required since the yard itself is isolated.  We started to Transload the car at about 0800 hrs.  We started to flare the car of its residual vapors at about 1430 hrs. and finished at 2230 hrs.  The car was labeled with Do Not Load and Home Shop Stickers and was stenciled “Cleaned”.",Not opinions of this release.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway,US,

The package was then placed into a line bin & brought to QA for processing.  Upon inspecting the packages exterior, the shipping label had a ""No-Air"" marking underneath the ground symbol, & and a slip that contained a Safety Data Sheet for the contents inside was found on one side of the box.  It was also discovered that the package did not have any Hazmat/Hazmat paperwork &/or Limited Quantity markings on the package which raised some concerns.  Upon opening the package 4 1-gallon cans of Seal For Life Industries Temper Kote 1000 41 Silver Industrial Heat Coating were found soiled & with the lids popped off causing them to leak contents.  3 out of 4 were also badly bent/dented & crushed on several areas of the can.  None of the 4 cans had paint clips to help prevent the lids from popping off & no packing material was inside the package to protect the cans exteriors. According to Spidr image the package appeared to be unharmed when viewing overhead images of the package at MIDD hub, meaning the package may have loaded improperly & damaged in transit as a result.  When referencing Section 14 under DOT classification in the Safety Data Sheet it was discovered the contents are classified as Packing Group 2 & as a Class 3 Flammable Liquid.  Several packages were leaked on as a result of the spill but were able to be successfully repacked.  The portion of the leftover cardboard from the repacks were held at the QA cage to be placed into the line salvage drum per cleanup.  The Improper Shipping Form & Damaged Package Report were filled out.  Contents & cardboard were placed into a line salvage drum & sealed.

While reversing into dock area at PepsiCo facility, vehicle struck another truck in lot, which damaged the saddle tank. Approximately 20 gallons of Diesel fuel were released to the asphalt surface and a minimal amount migrated to the nearby storm drain. PepsiCo personnel contained the release, and ACT Environmental was dispatched to perform the cleanup. Upon arrival on site, ACT Environmental applied absorbent material to the affected asphalt and inspected the nearby storm drain. Absorbent pads were utilized within storm drain catch basin to soak free product, and no further residual remained. Product was contained to the storm drain catch basin and did not migrate through drainage system. All spent absorbent material and pads were recovered and containerized into one 55-gallon drum, pending disposal in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.

It seems the loose bolts found on the top hatch cover allowed vapor to escape, causing the foul odor. After tightening the bolts, the odor dissipated over some time. The seals on the top hatch remained intact and undamaged.",Shipper should review incident to determine root cause and corrective measures.,No,TANK,PORTABLE TANK,57,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1500,BNSF - BNSF Railway Company,US,

The employee notified the on-duty transportation manager who then initiated an emergency response from the CN Dangerous Goods Team.  The responding CN DGO observed liquid dripping from the Bottom Outlet Valve cap (attached) with a strong vinegar type odor in the area. It was also noted that the valve handle was found to be in the fully closed position with a shipper supplied security seal intact. The bottom outlet valve cap was checked for tightness with a pipe wrench and was found to be loose (easily able to turn with a pipe wrench). The bottom outlet valve did not create a liquid tight seal while in the closed position in conjunction with an improperly tightened securement cap allowed the contents to leak out onto the ground.  The rail car has a faulty bottom outlet valve and will be transloaded in a shipper provided rail car.

The CMV jackknifed causing the  saddle tank to be crush and releasing diesel fuel on the roadway.   The driver failed to maintain control of the CMV and struck a guard rail. The roadway was wet and under construction (repaving) and the surface was uneven. No other vehicles were involved and no injuries were reported.  A local Hazmat clean-up company (ECOtech, 50 Easy Street, London, KY. 40741) responded to the scene. They tapped the fuel tank and transferred the contents to slow/stop the leak. The materials used were hydrocarbon exsorbent pads, absorbent booms, recovery drum, skid steer, and a dump truck for disposal.","The driver of the CMV that was involved in the accident/incident was terminated to help prevent recurrence.  All CDL required drivers are vetted to meet our company policy in regards to at least (1) one year CMV driving experience. The driver is also given a road test by an authorized driver that operates the same type CMV.   The company also provides onboarding and continual courses on our LMS.

Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 50-gallons of product released to a 23' x 8' area of the trailer floor and a 25' x 10' area of the concrete lot below. The release was caused by the tote falling on its side as a result of improper loading. The material was transferred from the damaged tote into a new one. Absorbent and vinegar were deployed and worked into the impacted areas to clean and neutralize the release. The impacted absorbents were containerized into (4) 55-gallon poly drums.

He brought 4000 gallons divided between multiple pockets of his trailer.  Company policy is to not exceed 90% of a tank's capacity, and upon arrival the driver determined the load would be very close to 90%, so he dropped one pocket at a time, sticking the tank before each pocket, and doing the math to ensure each pocket would fit.  Before dropping 1500 gallons from pocket #3, the driver disconnected the delivery hose to stick the tank.  He obtained the inch reading, converted it to gallons, did the required math, and determined the product in the pocket would fit.  He neglected to re-connect the delivery hose before releasing the product.  He realized his mistake immediately, and stopped the flow of product, but in the very short amount of time (just a few seconds, if that) approximately 51 gallons of product was released to the pavement near the fill.     The driver immediately gathered absorbent materials and pads from his spill kit, and did everything he could to contain the release, but product flowed away from the fill, entering a Central Maine Power (CMP) underground electrical vault.  After stopping the release and containing as much as he could, the driver called our company's 24/7 Safety line to report the spill.  The on-call Safety Manager immediately called 911 and was connected to Westbrook Fire who responded.  He then called Green Site Services for cleanup, and ME DEP who also responded.   When it was determined some quantity of gasoline had entered the electrical vault, the fire department evacuated the area and shut down the street until CMP was able to respond.  Ultimately all liquid was vacuumed out of the vault, a confined space team entered and pressure washed the vault, and speedy dry was applied to all surface material, and was subsequently removed and disposed of properly.  ME DEP was present for the clean-up as well, and approved.","This spill was the result of human error.  One simple, but very important step in the process was missed.  Delivery drivers use the same routine repeatedly, and distraction, stress, or many other factors can result in steps being missed.  All drivers, including the one involved in this delivery, will receive re-training with the focus on slowing down, ensuring accuracy and completion of all steps before commencing deliveries.",Yes,                             ,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,40512,DENNIS K.

He was traveling in the far right lane, when he fell asleep at the wheel. He awoke to stopped traffic in front of him without enough time to come to a safe stop. The driver jerked the wheel to the right to avoid contact with the vehicles in front of him and left the road way. He overturned on a side embankment at MM-43. Upon impact of the crash, a weld in the tank ruptured as well as one of the manhole covers on the top of the trailer. The product slowly leaked out of the trailer for approximately 1 hour. Other vehicles in traffic that witnessed the incident dialed 911. The driver contacted his employer, who in turn contacted Marion Environmental who was closer to the scene and could mitigate the release of gasoline quicker and more efficiently than the carrier could themselves. They set up absorbent booms to control the spilled product. The remainder of the product was pumped over into another trailer and safely transported to the original destination.",The driver who failed to maintain control of his vehicle was immediately terminated from his position at our company. Safety training and reminders were provided to current employees of the company.

The Occidental Chemical driver was loaded at an IMTT facility located in Geismar, LA. While the unloading process was underway, it was discovered that the bleeder valve on the product transfer line that goes to the product storage tank was left open. This resulted in approximately 2600 gallons of Hydrochloric acid being released from the product line into the containment area. No injuries or exposure to chemical occurred as a result of this event, as well as no off-site impact or environmental impact. The offloading process was halted, bleeder valve closed, containment area drained to sump for processing, and remainder of offload was completed.","The OxyChem truck driver immediately shut down the offloading operation upon discovery. The area was drained to a treatment sump, washed down and cleaned up.

CPKC Hazmat mobilized to the yard along with a railroad qualified response contractor to assist with mitigating the release. Upon arrival, responders found MTGX 7050 to be 85-90% empty. Also, the car needed to be switched into a track where it could be safely secured. Temporary measures were taken to stop the leak utilizing a freeze patch. Hazmat requested the car be isolated in a suitable track for further action. During switching to isolation, the freeze patch failed and after being isolated, the car finished depressurizing. Responders determined the source of the leak was a broken Liquid Sample Valve Feedline(V-13R) in right cabinet, and a loose fitting in the left cabinet on the PB Vapor Recovery Isolation/Check pipe fitting(RCV-1). The total estimated release is 15,336 gallons of liquid Argon(total load loss). The car was on hazmat hold until an OTMA-1 was obtained to move the car to home shop. File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated based on the best information available at the time of filing. This shipment was offered as a'bulk' shipment, aka one car load, therefore the exact amount offered in this package is not known to the carrier. This carrier does not have access to mass balance data which can exactly quantify this value.","The Kansas City Southern Railway(KCSR)(DBA CPKC) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases(NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases(a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause Investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCSR.(Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Carl Akins, KCSR Railway, P.O.

Univar Solutions' Driver called dispatch on arrival to customer to report a small release. Driver reported the gasket was pinched on the dome manway which allowed product into the spill box of trailer. Driver backed into the unloading area and noticed a trail of caustic drips leading down the pavement into customer's unloading area. Driver pulled the trailer out of the pitched area to refasten the dome gasket. Driver got the customer's employee to review the release. Customer personnel cleaned up the drips with rags and water. An incident report was filled out and signed by customer.   Further investigation indicated the air valve was open on the trailer and Driver did not conduct a thorough pre trip on the trailer catching the open air valve. The released product at the customer was a result of the open air valve and not the dome gasket.,The driver was retrained on proper pre-trip inspection policies and procedures.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,UNIVAR SOLUTIONS USA INC.,US,

First Call Environmental utilized a drum vacuum to recover the free product from the storm drain catch basin, and confirmed product was contained to catch basin and did not migrate through the sewer system.

The employee determined that the spill was from one 55-1A2 open top metal drum containing ""UN1325, Waste Flammable Solids, Organic, n.o.s. (Petroleum Hydrocarbons), 4.1, III, RQ (D001)."" The leak was traced to a pinhole puncture in the drum. The poor integrity of the container previously went unnoticed because the puncture did not puncture the exterior paint; a blister had formed and kept the liquid from spilling until the blister ruptured. Approximately 5 gallons of liquid was released until the leak stopped on its own over the weekend and was discovered the following morning.  While the employee moved the drum to be overpacked and was taking pictures of the incident, the drum began to leak again from the same blister.   The employee overpacked the drum, put down oil dry to clean the spill, made sure no other drums were also leaking, and contacted management to inform them of the incident.","It's currently unknown what caused the leak. The drum had no obvious signs of damage on the exterior, and the pinhole seemed to be formed from within the drum. Potential causes could be faults in the drum that were not visible from the exterior, or the waste itself causing the pinholes due to potential contaminants, debris, or other components of the waste material.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The  employee notified the Transportation Manager who in turn notified the CN Dangerous Goods Team. The tank car  was set out to an isolation track (WA90) for inspection by a CN emergency response contractor.  A CN emergency responsecontractor was dispatched to thelocation for mitigation.Thecontractor performed an  inspection of the tank car and found the bottom outlet valve to be leaking from the threads of the bottom outlet  valve cap. It was determined that there was a failure in the sealing surface of the valve seat to include a defective  gasket. (The BOV cap was found to be less than tool tight and the BOV in the closed position and pinned upon initial  inspection). CN emergency response contractor did observe cable seal to be correctly in place. The BOV cap was  removed and it was observed to be leaking past the closed ball.  The BOV valve handle was cycled several times to the open and closed position to freeany debris that may have  been trapped in the BOV sealing surface potentially causing theleak.The BOV cap was then removed and observed  for 20 minutes to ensurethere was no further leakagefrom thevalve. It was noted that the BOV cap gasket was  deformed and was replaced. The bottom outlet valve cap was then re-installed and tightened with a 36"" pipe wrench.  Upon tightening the BOV cap, CN emergency response contractor proceeded to place new cable seals on the BOV /  Cap.",,No,TANK CAR,,117R100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,20000,CCP,US,

She was under the impression that the unit was new because it was packaged that way and she had no reason to believe otherwise. There were no fumes or noticeable stains on the box. She presented it to the American Airlines ticket counter in PHL for her AA 4602/4342 PHL-LGA-XNA flights operated by Republic Airways, Inc. TSA scanned the item in PHL before being loaded on the aircraft and no dangerous goods were present. Ground crew in PHL loaded it on the aircraft. The unit shipped to LGA and no noticeable spills or fumes were observed by LGA ground crew and the package continued to XNA. Once in XNA ground crew noticed approximately 1 qt leaked on the cargo floor and some luggage. Republic Ops, Maintenance and Dangerous Goods were contacted immediately. On call maintenance contractors for Republic Airways were called out and cleaned the aircraft quickly with several cleaning agents. The extent of gasoline spilled on the cargo floor was minimal.","The FAA PHI for Republic was notified immediately after the Republic DG Manager was made aware. The telephonic NRC report (1400188) was filed on 5/28/2024 at 1822. After getting statements and pictures from AA ops and DG management it was determined the AA ticket counter in PHL followed procedures for accepting the gas generator. No one had any way of knowing the Lowes generator sold to the passenger was, in fact, not used and clearly a returned generator that was resold.

Railcar was empty (residue) at time of incident, previously contained Methyl Ethyl Ketone (UN 1193, STCC 4909243).  Upon subsequent Shipper re-inspection following the incident, the Shipper determined that the cause of odor venting was due to a damaged (worn) manway gasket.","Suggest that Shipper add inspection of manway gaskets to their railcar shipment inspection procedures, or if already contained therein, provide refresher training on said inspection procedures to Shipper personnel performing said inspections.",No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,ROGUE VALLEY TERMINAL RAILROAD CORPORATION,US,

Standard Petroleum's driver was ' traveling on the 1-95 - southbound in the right lane (of3). As Standard Petroleum's driver approached exit 14 on 1-95 southbound, a black Chevy Camaro struck Standard Petroleum's upper right side as the Camaro driver crossed a solid white line when it merged into traffic. After striking Standard Petroleum's vehicle, the Camaro then struck a trailer traveling parallel to Standard Petroleum m the middle lane, which caused the trailer to strike Standard Petroleum's vehicle. The cause of the failure is still being investigated; however, it is Standard Petroleum s understanding that the trailer struck Standard Petroleum's fuel tank which caused a fuel leak. Since the investigation is ongoing, Standard Petroleum is not able to describe the package failure with specificity at this time. ?nee Standard Petroleum's driver discovered the fuel leak, he immediately called 911 and notified Stand ard Petroleum dispatch of the incident. It is Standard Petroleum's unders!anding that either DEEP or Connecticut State Police notified Standard Republic, who is an environmental first responder for the State of Connecticut, to remedy the fuel leak.","Standard Petroleum is actively investigating this matter and reviewing all information received to date to determine appropriate changes and/or adjustments to its operations, training, and/or procedures to help prevent recurrence.

When accepting the shipment the ANC based employee asked the shipper if there was any dangerous goods in the shipment. The shipper stated that the package did not contain any dangerous goods. Based on this information, the shipment was accepted by Sterling and placed in storage until the next available flight to DUT. On May 30th, 2024, this shipment was transported on VC1101 to DUT around 8:30am. The next day, as part of the Manager of Ground Operations Standards normal processes, she reviewed the airway bill and discovered that there was a laptop in the description section of the airway bill. All airway bills currently are reviewed no later than the next day by Manager A. The review process of all airway bills was put into place due to cargo being a new process to the airline. The continued monitoring of airway bills is to ensure everything is done correctly. When the Manager of Ground Operations Standards discovered the laptop in the description section, she notified the Anchorage Station Manager of this discovery. The Station Manager then contacted the agent who was involved in creating this airway bill, and verified that there was in fact a laptop transported. Both the Manager of Ground Operations Standards and the Anchorage Station Manager verified that this should not have been transported due to the possibility of a lithium battery in the laptop, as described in section 1.2.C in the Cargo Acceptance Handbook which prohibits transport of lithium batteries. This event was immediately brought to the leadership's attention and notification was sent out to all managers and cargo agents and an investigation was opened.","Based on Sterling's internal SMS process, the following enhancements have been made or are in the process of being implemented: 1. Provide immediate coaching to the employee who made the mistake. 2. Notify and educate all personnel who handle cargo to explain the error that was made and bring awareness. 3. Update the training to include more specifics on items that include lithium batteries. 4. Revise the monitoring system to ensure that the airway bills are reviewed prior to shipment. 5. Revise the airway bill to include a reminder of specific items such as laptops. 6. Add verbiage to the Limited Cargo Acceptance Handbook(LCAH) to outline the procedure for screening cargo shipments for DG.

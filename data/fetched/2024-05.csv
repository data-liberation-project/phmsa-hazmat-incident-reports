The exterior of the drum appeared damaged by friction with another drum causing the puncture. The  drum contained the product, ‘Lemon Sage Fragrance’. The release was approximately 1-gallon and impacted the wooden trailer floor in an 8’x6’ area. The Contractor cleaned-up the release with absorbent rags and overpacked the damaged drum. One drum of waste was generated from this incident.

The release was caused by the tote falling on its side as a result of improper loading. The material was transferred from the damaged tote into a new one. Absorbent and vinegar were deployed and worked into the impacted areas to clean and neutralize the release. The impacted absorbents were containerized into (4) 55-gallon poly drums.

He brought 4000 gallons divided between multiple pockets of his trailer.  Company policy is to not exceed 90% of a tank's capacity, and upon arrival the driver determined the load would be very close to 90%, so he dropped one pocket at a time, sticking the tank before each pocket, and doing the math to ensure each pocket would fit.  Before dropping 1500 gallons from pocket #3, the driver disconnected the delivery hose to stick the tank.  He obtained the inch reading, converted it to gallons, did the required math, and determined the product in the pocket would fit.  He neglected to re-connect the delivery hose before releasing the product.  He realized his mistake immediately, and stopped the flow of product, but in the very short amount of time (just a few seconds, if that) approximately 51 gallons of product was released to the pavement near the fill.     The driver immediately gathered absorbent materials and pads from his spill kit, and did everything he could to contain the release, but product flowed away from the fill, entering a Central Maine Power (CMP) underground electrical vault.  After stopping the release and containing as much as he could, the driver called our company's 24/7 Safety line to report the spill.  The on-call Safety Manager immediately called 911 and was connected to Westbrook Fire who responded.  He then called Green Site Services for cleanup, and ME DEP who also responded.   When it was determined some quantity of gasoline had entered the electrical vault, the fire department evacuated the area and shut down the street until CMP was able to respond.  Ultimately all liquid was vacuumed out of the vault, a confined space team entered and pressure washed the vault, and speedy dry was applied to all surface material, and was subsequently removed and disposed of properly.  ME DEP was present for the clean-up as well, and approved.","This spill was the result of human error.  One simple, but very important step in the process was missed.  Delivery drivers use the same routine repeatedly, and distraction, stress, or many other factors can result in steps being missed.  All drivers, including the one involved in this delivery, will receive re-training with the focus on slowing down, ensuring accuracy and completion of all steps before commencing deliveries.",Yes,,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,40512,DENNIS K.

The employee determined that the spill was from one 55-1A2 open top metal drum containing ""UN1325, Waste Flammable Solids, Organic, n.o.s. (Petroleum Hydrocarbons), 4.1, III, RQ (D001)."" The leak was traced to a pinhole puncture in the drum. The poor integrity of the container previously went unnoticed because the puncture did not puncture the exterior paint; a blister had formed and kept the liquid from spilling until the blister ruptured. Approximately 5 gallons of liquid was released until the leak stopped on its own over the weekend and was discovered the following morning.  While the employee moved the drum to be overpacked and was taking pictures of the incident, the drum began to leak again from the same blister.   The employee overpacked the drum, put down oil dry to clean the spill, made sure no other drums were also leaking, and contacted management to inform them of the incident.","It's currently unknown what caused the leak. The drum had no obvious signs of damage on the exterior, and the pinhole seemed to be formed from within the drum. Potential causes could be faults in the drum that were not visible from the exterior, or the waste itself causing the pinholes due to potential contaminants, debris, or other components of the waste material.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

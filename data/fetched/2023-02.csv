In the interest of safety, the unit was placed inside of the Hazmat containment pit pending a cargo inspection. Environmental contractor (United Pumping) was dispatched to perform a cargo inspection and to remediate the leaking product along with the affected areas.  Interior inspection revealed mixed palletized freight varying in sizes and weights with a secondary layer on load bars, the pallets were stowed two rows wide throughout the container, there was no cargo securement applied on this shipment which is required per the BNSF Intermodal Rules and Policies Guide. Upon further investigation a failed pallet loaded with ""Motor City Clearcoat"" UN1263 was found to be the source of the leak. 6 bottles containing 1.325 U.S. Gallons were found empty and 20 more were found to be damaged and leaking for a total of approximately 10 gallons spilled that did reach the ground.

One package appeared and I saw that it was currently in trailer 828334 on door 213 at our location. I checked SPIDR and package did appear to have leakage visible, along with being undeclared. I alerted management and because an odor could be smelled coming from the trailer, upper management and safety specialists were contacted and the decision was made to call a spill team. Per directions from the safety specialist, the trailer was taken off door 213 and put in the yard with the door open to allow it to air out. Total number of packages in the trailer was 531. I checked all packages scanned into the trailer and saw there was one flammable gas package (UN1057). 4-person spill team from Hazchem Environmental arrived at around 10:30 PM. The trailer was moved to door 9 and the hazmat team parked their truck on door 10. Trailer was opened, hazmat team suited up in level C PPE and tested air, no alert. They unloaded the trailer with no air quality alerts until the rear. There was a strong odor. Package was discovered in the belly of the trailer. Spill team opened box and confirmed leakage. There were two bottles inside and both were leaking. DescribePack: Both bottles were leaking. The bottles were each inside a bag and both bags had free liquid. The bottles were placed in a larger non-hazmat bag that was not secured shut. There was some evidence of dried leakage on box. DurationRel: 192 and MitigateEffect: HAZCHEM Spill team placed the package in a white salvage drum with DOT hazard labels and hazardous waste label. Drum and box were removed by HAZCHEM for disposal. HAZCHEM said the trailer was not contaminated. Trailer was closed and left on door 9 in the unload with around half of the packages still inside. HAZCHEM departed with the package at around 11:55 PM 2/12/23. Spoke to team manager and he estimated cost of response as around 4,200 dollars, and around 250 for disposal of the package. The cost of the incident is just an estimate.

It was discovered that the drum broke through the pallet in transit. The container was immediately turned on its side to prevent further release of material. The released material was cleaned up with absorbent material and placed in an overpack for appropriate disposal. We were unable to safely obtain the identification markings on the drum due to the material being hazardous.,This incident may have been prevented had the skid being used for the drums remained intact.

The leak was reported to the CN Dangerous Goods Officer who subsequently responded to the incident. The responding CN DGO observed liquid dripping from the bottom of the protective housing which had a security seal intact. The seal was removed and all valves were inspected for leakage and finding the ""Liquid Eduction Line Securement Flange"" to be dripping as a result of the (4) securement fasteners to be less than tool tight which allowed the internal pressure to force liquid up and out of the loose flange. The (4) flange fasteners were tightened with an 12"" adjustable wrench until the leak was stopped. The internal pressure was then released through the 1"" vapor valve. The liquid line securement flange was removed for the purpose of inspecting the gasket which appeared to be un-damaged. The securement flange was again re-installed. The rail car was sent to an isolation track within the rail yard for exterior decontamination and then released back into transportation.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,No,,,111S100W,Yes,,,,ZZ,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,20001,Illinois Central Railroad,US,

The car was isolated and the shipper of record (UNIVAR), National Response Center, West Virginia DEP, Federal Railroad Administration Field Inspector, and contracted loading entity (CHEMOURS) were notified.  (CHEMTREC Report #2023-0217-00125). Enviroserve, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found approximately 35 psi of head pressure on the car detected by pressure gauge on the vapor valve. When attempting to bleed the pressure off the car, free liquid was observed coming from the vapor valve. Approximately 1 gallon of product was recovered from the vapor valve / vapor line, and the fill hole was opened. Upon accessing the fill hole product was observed inside the fill hold housing, the car identified as shell full. Specialized Professional Services, Inc was contracted by the loading entity to unload approximately 500 gallons from the car. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Mr. Doug Nestler of UNIVAR and Ryan Goldsmith of CHEMOURS. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move. 7.1 is not required.  Cause Code: 106 NARRI: 100",NAR code: no code available.

The driver had offloaded ~ ½ load at his first stop & had driven 2 hrs north on I-75 in the Macon Ga area. Once the driver was in an area on I-75 where visibility was clear, streetlights, he noticed more than just vapor coming from the rear of the trailer. He exited I-75 to an area where he could have more visibility on the situation. Upon review the PBC was stuck open. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to close the valve, he maneuvered to a safer location.  The driver found an area with concert to park over and out of travel lanes to better handle the situation. Management made the decision to contact the fire department to maintain control over the area & dispatched a shop mechanic & empty trailer. At 0030 the trailer had successfully been offloaded and area cleared.  No injuries or disruption to the I-75 corridor.  Site Supervisor was the first to arrive on scene. With the assistance of FD, the PBC valve was thawed out & ~ 3 revolutions were turned on the valve to close. The valve was felt to be in the closed position however liquid continued to vent.

In the interest of safety, the unit was placed inside of the Hazmat containment pit pending a cargo inspection. Environmental contractor (United Pumping) was dispatched to perform a cargo inspection and to remediate the leaking product along with the affected areas.  Interior inspection revealed mixed palletized freight varying in sizes and weights with a secondary layer on load bars, the pallets were stowed two rows wide throughout the container, there was no cargo securement applied on this shipment which is required per the BNSF Intermodal Rules and Policies Guide. Upon further investigation a failed pallet loaded with ""Motor City Clearcoat"" UN1263 was found to be the source of the leak. 6 bottles containing 1.325 U.S. Gallons were found empty and 20 more were found to be damaged and leaking for a total of approximately 10 gallons spilled that did reach the ground.

One package appeared and I saw that it was currently in trailer 828334 on door 213 at our location. I checked SPIDR and package did appear to have leakage visible, along with being undeclared. I alerted management and because an odor could be smelled coming from the trailer, upper management and safety specialists were contacted and the decision was made to call a spill team. Per directions from the safety specialist, the trailer was taken off door 213 and put in the yard with the door open to allow it to air out. Total number of packages in the trailer was 531. I checked all packages scanned into the trailer and saw there was one flammable gas package (UN1057). 4-person spill team from Hazchem Environmental arrived at around 10:30 PM. The trailer was moved to door 9 and the hazmat team parked their truck on door 10. Trailer was opened, hazmat team suited up in level C PPE and tested air, no alert. They unloaded the trailer with no air quality alerts until the rear. There was a strong odor. Package was discovered in the belly of the trailer. Spill team opened box and confirmed leakage. There were two bottles inside and both were leaking. DescribePack: Both bottles were leaking. The bottles were each inside a bag and both bags had free liquid. The bottles were placed in a larger non-hazmat bag that was not secured shut. There was some evidence of dried leakage on box. DurationRel: 192 and MitigateEffect: HAZCHEM Spill team placed the package in a white salvage drum with DOT hazard labels and hazardous waste label. Drum and box were removed by HAZCHEM for disposal. HAZCHEM said the trailer was not contaminated. Trailer was closed and left on door 9 in the unload with around half of the packages still inside. HAZCHEM departed with the package at around 11:55 PM 2/12/23. Spoke to team manager and he estimated cost of response as around 4,200 dollars, and around 250 for disposal of the package. The cost of the incident is just an estimate.

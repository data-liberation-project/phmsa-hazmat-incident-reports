During a routine unloading operation, a Veolia employee was using a forklift to remove a pallet from a trailer when the forklift's forks accidentally punctured a drum positioned behind the pallet being unloaded. As a result of this incident, less than one gallon of waste flammable liquid was released from the punctured drum. Immediate action was taken to address the situation by promptly overpacking the damaged drum to prevent further leakage. Hazmat-trained Veolia employees conducted a thorough remediation of the spilled material.

Upon investigation, they determined that the leaking drum had been collected from a previous customer, Hentzen. The employees located the source of the leak, which was coming from the top of the drum.  After a thorough inspection, the seal was identified as the cause of the problem. The employees theorized that the truck's vibration during transport had caused the paint to seep through the faulty top seal. Fortunately, the spill was contained within the truck, and no paint had leaked outside while the vehicle was in motion.  The team took immediate action to address the situation. They contained the spill and overpacked the drum, along with all materials used in the cleanup process. This prompt response ensured that the incident was managed efficiently and safely, minimizing any potential environmental impact or further complications.","Prior to filling, it is essential for customers to thoroughly examine all containers, including their gaskets and seals. Any containers found to have defective components should be immediately removed from circulation and not used for waste transportation or overpacked prior to shipment.

Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of 2 cups of Greasestrip Plus (UN1824, 8, II) from (1) 1-gallon container onto the trailer floor. The release was reportedly due to products rubbing together and creating a leak, impacting a 4’ x 4’ area in the trailer. No drains or waterways were impacted by the release. The release was neutralized then cleaned up with absorbents and the proper PPE. Recovered product was re-palletized for the client per client’s instruction.

(UN1263, 3, III) from (1) 55-gallon metal drum onto the trailer floor and asphalt. The release was reportedly due to a puncture of the drum, impacting a 20’ x 10’ area in the trailer and a 20’ x 7’ area on the asphalt. No drains or waterways were impacted by the release. The release was cleaned up with absorbents and the proper PPE. The damaged drum was secured in an overpack and continued on with the original consignee. All waste generated from addressing this release was containerized in (1) 55-gallon DM, which was then taken offsite by the contractor for proper disposal.

At approximately 05:50, during the loading process, one of the placard/label frames on one of the totes caught the wall. The label frame was bent, ripped off of the tote, and punctured the 275-gallon tote. The tote immediately started Ieaking from the side. Approximately 10-gallons leaked inside of the trailer& on the dock. The tote was manuvered immediately& containment measures were performed to assure no further Ieakage. None of the chemical(UN3264) spilled onto the ground, or near water/drainage systems. Southeastern Freight Lines Safety was contacted at approximately 06:00. Safety contacted Hazmat 1, and Hazmat 1 contacted E3/OMI Environmental Services. Louisiana State Police arrived at approximately 08:00. E3/OMI arrived at approximately 09:00.

""Ross Transportation Services arrived at the Dayton branch to transport waste to Ross from Dayton. When the warehouse worker inspected the trailer to load he found liquid on the floor of the trailer. At the time there was no waste leaking from the trailer. The Ross driver was advised of the leaker and asked to pull out of the dock into the truck lot where we placed containment under the trailer to keep any of the waste from reaching the ground. At this point we have not determined which container is leaking for sure but believe it to by a flammable hazardous waste that is contained in a .275 gallon tote. It appears to be a very slow leak since none is escaping the trailer and the floor does not showing signs of significant leaking. Four totes of the same profile are loaded onto the rear of the Ross trailer. NRC was contacted for emergency response to handle the leaker and any clean up required. The ETA for the clean up contractor is 3:00 pm ET. There has been no exposure of employees nor any release to the ground.   ER crew arrived on site and we determined the leaker was actually a DM of profile E80-9351A RIS which is a hazardous waste which is a flammable liquid, toxic and corrosive. It looks like less than a gallon escaped onto the trailer floor. The drum had a hole in the lower portion of the side of the drum which was allowing a very slow leak of the contents. The crew overpacked the drum using an overpack from Dayton branch. They used floor dry to clean up the trailer floor and placed the floor dry in the overpack with the drum. The overpack was labeled and loaded Back on the Ross trailer. The Dayton customer waste is being loaded onto the Ross trailer for shipment to Ross.""",Details have been forwarded back to the Univar Facility in Charlotte for them to identify the cause of the hole in the drum.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"ROSS TRANSPORTATION SERVICES, INC.",US,

To create space for additional drums in Veolia's truck, a Veolia employee began stacking empty 55 gallon containers that were already loaded in the truck. The Veolia employee misjudged the weight of one drum, assuming it contained residual waste when it actually weighed approximately 60 pounds. As a result, the drum slipped out of his hands, fell, and was punctured at the bottom when it struck a metal panel attached to the truck. Approximately 1 liter of fluid spilled from the drum. Spill pads were immediately placed to contain the spill and the spill was reported internally to request additional personnel to assist with the cleanup. At approximately 2:30PM (estimate), additional Veolia employees arrived to apply a hydrofluoric acid eater to the spill area along with the necessary PPE for proper management.  No spill was released outside of the truck.",Veolia will implement the following corrective actions:  1. Conduct refresher training sessions with employees on proper container weight assessment procedures before handling.  2. Reinforce the importance of performing thorough routine inspections to:    - Verify container security    - Identify potential hazards  3. Reemphasize company policy prohibiting the double stacking of containers containing free liquids.

The material was transferred from the damaged tote into a new one. Absorbents were worked into the impacted area. The empty damaged tote was then cut up and containerized along with all impacted absorbents into (2) 30-gallon poly drums. The waste was staged onsite for terminal personnel to manage.,NO COMMENTS PROVIDED,No,                             ,,,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,6500,ERTS,US,

Upon investigation, they found that inner packages had leaked through three outer containers and were generating heat through a chemical reaction with the absorbent material present. It was determined that 5 x 1 gallon inner packages in each of the three containers were not upright and had leaked through vented caps onto an absorbent. It was further determined the absorbent utilized by the shipper contained organic material which resulted in the reaction and heat generation. The material was repackaged with all inner packages up right and placed in individual plastic bags with inorganic cushioning and absorbent to prevent any reaction resulting in three 55 gallon drums and one 30 gallon drum.

When the light turned green, the operator began accelerating to make 90 degree left tum onto Fletcher Parkway. The tum is an""off-camber turn"" as the outer tum radius surface is lower than the inner tum radius. The driver failed to respond correctly to this surface condition. As the CTMV turned, the liquid cargo surged to the passenger side of the cargo compartments. The sudden weight shift caused the CTMV to roll over to the right. The CTMV rotated 180 degrees clockwise and came to rest upside down straddling the roadway and sidewalk. Fuel began Ieaking through the venting devices mounted between the rollover rails on the top of the semi-trailer. The fuel flowed downhill along the sidewalk and curb. Fuel entered two storm drain entry points before the entry points were closed by sand bagging. The storm drain was dry down stream. While upside down, the compartments were tapped, and approximately 400 gallons were recovered from the compartments. Fuel recovery and remediation steps were begun immediately. Approximately 1500 gallons were recovered from a concrete utility pit located within the sidewalk underneath the upside down CTMV. The remaining fuel is being recovered by cleaning the storm drain conduit and replacing soil that has absorbed fuel downstream from the spill site. Asphalt roadway surface is being replaced for approximately 200 feet downhill from the spill site. The fuel did not enter any waterway.",will be given on CTMV stability during turning maneuvers and off-camber roadways. This event was captured by our onboard camera system. The video will be shown to all CTMV operators during upcoming safety meetings with additional emphasis on selecting proper entry speed when making turns.,Yes,                             ,Cargo tanks,NO MARKI,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,2607950,"COASTAL TRANSPORT CO., INC.",US,

He placed the absorbent pads he had, to catch what he could and notified his supervisor. His supervisor immediately notified TWC regulatory dept. We then determined what was Leaking and reached out to our response company whom notified DHEC and located a company who could respond. We decided to send personnel from our Spartanburg facility with more pads and catch containers. They arrived before the response company and were able to move some material around on the trailer and where able to close the valve on the IBC and re-secure the dust cap on the tote. They then started using pads to absorb what product they could, as DHEC and the Response company arrived.

When arriving in Chattanooga the supervisor at the plant noticed a small amount of product coming out of the trailer towards the nose. When opening the door there was one drum of 40 discovered to be leaking. Hepaco was called on site and maintained/handled the cleanup. It was discovered that a drum was punctured by a nail on a pallet losing approximately 3301bs of sodium bisulfite. It looked like the drum may have shifted slightly and hit the nail. When leaving Norcross there were not any issues or signs of damage to the drum.,After the incident we had an internal investigation and will begin using an extra strap on drums to prevent any kind of movement. We also have contacted our pallet supplier to discuss expectations on pallet condition and making sure nails are driven into pallets properly. This is something Univar does regularly and have not had any previous issues.,Yes,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,UNIVAR SOLUTIONS,US,

They immediately notified their supervisor, and the material was identified as ""UN2586 Aryl Sulfonic Acids, Liquid with Not More than 5% Free Sulfuric Acid (4-Dodecylbenzenesulfonic Acid), 8, III."" Approximately <= 10 mL of free liquids had leaked onto the warehouse floor.  The team immediately overpacked the material and used vermiculite absorbent to clean up residual liquids from the floor. After reviewing the incident, two conditions leading to the spill were discovered:  1.) A small cut in the inner liner near the top of the bag was discovered. Veolia believes this was caused during the initial packaging process or after someone reopened the box with a safety blade. This allowed for vermiculite absorbent and free liquids to escape the liner and leak into the box interior.  2.) The bottom of the box was not sealed properly; the middle seam was taped as required, but the side seams were left untaped, which allowed an easier pathway for the interior fluid to escape.",The local Veolia management team will review proper packaging guidelines for this type of container and will ensure that all field teams are fully trained in the proper use and closure methods of these containers.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

Initially, they attributed the smell to recently filled drums. However, upon relocating the vehicle, they discovered a pinhole leak in the top of one drum, just below the upper chime.  The affected container was a 55-gallon plastic drum, and it is believed that the puncture occurred during its removal from the storage location. Upon discovering the leak, employees promptly reported the incident and transferred the leaking drum into an 851A2 salvage drum to ensure safe transportation to the final disposal facility.  Approximately one pint of halogenated solvent waste escaped from the drum. The spill was quickly contained using spill pads and absorbent materials. The leaking drum, along with the cleanup materials, was then placed into an appropriate salvage drum.  Given the small size of the hole and the rapid response of the team, the release is estimated to have lasted about 10 minutes. The drum was still largely full when the leak was detected, and the quantity released did not exceed the reportable quantity (RQ) threshold.","Following the incident on October 16, 2024, the Veolia safety manager was promptly informed. A subsequent investigation revealed that the drum in question had been provided by the customer. It is believed that the pinhole was present in the drum at the time of its acquisition.  The investigation concluded that human error did not directly contribute to the cause of the leak. The only oversight was the initial failure to detect the existing damage during the preliminary inspection.  As a result of this incident, both Veolia employees and the customer have committed to implementing more rigorous inspection protocols. Moving forward, there will be an increased emphasis on thoroughly examining drums for any signs of damage or potential leaks before handling or transport. This enhanced vigilance aims to prevent similar incidents in the future and improve overall safety practices.",No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

UTLX 202686 was a loaded tank car of Acetone from the Advansix Plant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Conrail Hazardous Material Manager, Joe Caaccamo was in the yard and responded to inspect the tank car. Upon inspection  liquid was visible coming from the breadbox seal number ADVANSIX 074737 was intact on the breadbox. The seal was removed and the liquid line was found in the open position well as the secondary securement plug less than tool tight. Once the valve was placed in the closed position the leak stopped entirely. The secondary securement plug was properly secured and all material was dissipating/evaporating from the tank car.

During the subsequent loading process for outbound transportation, facility personnel observed liquid on the floor near the drum's location.  Upon investigation, it was discovered that a pinhole in the bottom chime of the drum had allowed its contents to leak. To address this issue, the following actions were taken:  1. The compromised drum was immediately overpacked to ensure safe continued transportation. 2. The affected concrete surface was thoroughly decontaminated in full compliance with the procedures outlined in 40 CFR § 761.79(b)(4).  These prompt actions ensured the containment of the spill, the safe handling of the drum, and the proper remediation of the affected area, all in accordance with applicable regulations and safety protocols.","To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following corrective actions have been implemented:   1. Pre-Transport Inspection: Veolia field employees were reminded to perform a rigorous inspection of all drums before they are removed from the customer's site. This includes a thorough visual and physical check of each drum, with particular attention to the bottom chime and other potential weak points.  2. Secondary Inspection at 10-Day Facility: Upon arrival at the 10-Day facility, all drums will undergo a second comprehensive inspection before being placed in the storage area. This double-check process aims to identify any damages or potential leaks that may have been overlooked or occurred during transit.  These measures are designed to reduce the risk of accepting or handling compromised drums, thereby enhancing overall safety and transportation and environmental compliance.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The Lexington County Fire Service responded to the scene. The rollover resulted in approximately 1500 gallons of ULSD being released on to the ground. The spilt fuel was recovered/remediated by Republic Services. The remaining product was pumped from the rolled over trailer to a trailer brought on scene by Barnes Oil & Propane Representatives.",All CDL drivers will immediately be retrained in Cargo Tank Rollover prevention techniques and the effects of liquid sloshing.,Yes,                             ,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,75000,BARNES OIL AND PROPANE INC,US,

Approximately 3,500 gallons of unleaded gasoline spilled onto the shoulder of the roadway.  The Texas Department of Public Safety responded to the scene and notified United Petroleum Transports, Inc.  UPT then contracted an Environmental Clean up Service.  The Environmental Clean up Service went the scene and contained the spill.  It the went through the process of removing the contaminated soil and replacing it with clean soil.  The final remediation was done on 11/11/2024 and report was sent to TXDEQ.

A rail qualified response contractor was mobilized to investigate and mitigate the release. Upon arrival, OFOX 60804 was found to be Ieaking from the A end hopper on the left side at the bottom camlock cap fitting. The A end hopper was found to have less than 1/8 of a compartment of liquid and solid solution. OFOX 60804 was also found to be Ieaking from the B end hopper on the left side where the bottom of the hopper is fastened to the frame of the car. The B end hopper was found with over 1/2 of a compartment of liquid and solid solution. It appeared that the shipper failed to fully unload the hoppers before releasing the car into transportation. Estimated release from the A end hopper is 9 gallons. Estimated release from the B end hopper is 1 gallon. Responders stopped the release from the A end hopper by securing a nitrile glove over the camlock cap fitting and the loading/unloading line with duct tape and a tension strap. Containment was placed under the point of release emanating from the B end hopper and sealant was applied to the seam where the bottom of the hopper is fastened to the frame of the car to stop the leak. The source of the B end hopper release was.inside the hopper and could not be accessed. The contents of OFOX 60804 were transferred Into a tank truck, and then the hoppers were rinsed with water. The root defect was not determined for the A end bottom camlock cap fitting, though it was thought to have been attributable to a loose component. Likewise, the source of the release on the B end was not determined because it was not visible; however, due to the nature of the commodity moved in this specialized hopper car, it is likely to be attributable·to a failure in a weld or seam within the hopper. File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated based on the best info,„iation available at the time of filing. This shipment was offered as a'bulk' shipment, aka one car load, therefore the exact amount offered in this package is not known to the carrier. This carrier does not have access to mass balance data which can exactly quantify this value.","The SOO LINE RAILROAD COMPANY(DBA CPKC) notified shipper of this release. Continued emphasis with Offerors/Shippers is made to conduct thorough inspections prior to movement in order to reduce valve failures in the field. Non Accidental Releases(NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases(a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with SOO Line Railroad(Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Ed Dankbar, SOO Line Railroad, 120 S 6th ST STE 900, Minneapolis, MN 55402.

The car was set out to an isolation track. All departments were notified leading to an emergency response from a CN Dangerous Goods Team contractor. The responding contractor observed a small amount of liquid (PH tested ?1?) within the protective housing. All securement nuts on the air and liquid valve were verified to be tool tight. There was no obvious point of the leak during the initial inspection. The tank car was pressurized with dry air to 10 psi for the purpose of identifying the exact origin of the leak. The pressure test revealed a minuscule leak emanating from the spool of the liquid eduction line through what appeared to be a pin sized hole. The tank car was completely de-pressurized through a scrubbing media. The pinhole on the spool was wrapped with chemical tape to prevent any further leakage. The car owner was notified of the findings and will send a qualified mobile repair unit out to replace the spool and re-qualify the tank car. 10-31-2024 the tank car owner performed an assessment of the tank car. Below is their findings: Technicians from our Saint Gabreil, LA certified shop responded to RCRX 2542 on 10/31/2024.  Upon arrival, the technician's initial inspection found product residue inside the protective housing.  In addition, there appeared to be no gasket present below the product blind flange which was confirmed after removing the blind flange.  A product gasket was applied and secured.  The car was then pressurized to 30 psi and a certified leak test was performed to all fittings and connections with no leaks found.   The residue product was rinsed off of the fittings and side of car.  Security seals were applied as well to the fittings.",no comment provided,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,18091,IC,US,

He drove from his parking location at 15222 Hudson Ave., Spring Hill, FL to the Orlando, FL terminal to load his truck. He made two deliveries - the first being in Palmetto, FL at an AmeriGas facility, and the last being in Clearwater a the AmeriGas facility. When Transport Driver completed the final delivery in Clearwater, he drove back to his parking location at 15222 Hudson Ave., Spring Hill, FL, which is an AmeriGas property.   To access this location, the Transport Driver backs in off the roadway to get into the yard. On this morning at 0522, he pulled up headed westbound on Hudson Ave. and began his backing maneuver traveling 3 mph. He was across both lanes of traffic in the middle of his maneuver when a 3rd party vehicle traveling eastbound on Hudson Ave. crashed into the transport trailer. The Transport Driver immediately got out of the vehicle to assess the situation and called 911.   When emergency personnel arrived on scene, the scene was secured and the leak was assessed. There was a small leak coming from the flange of the pump under the transport and emergency personnel and AmeriGas decided it would be best to evacuate the remaining propane in the transport by flaring it off. The responding fire dept. utilized water spray to dissipate some of the propane vapor under the transport before they were able to flare. The leak lasted for roughly 2 hours before flaring equipment could be set up and utilized. The flare was set up and remaining propane was burnt off prior to the transport and 3rd party vehicle being moved and the road re-opened.",AmeriGas is reassessing this parking location for our transport truck. AmeriGas will be looking for off site parking that will allow for our driver to not have to back off of a roadway in order to access the property and park.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,115050,"AMERIGAS PROPANE, INC.",US,

(WFS) transport driver when starting their shift at 04:30 called the HSE Manager to report a spill at the WFS Milford Bulk Plant. They reported there was diesel spilled throughout the facility yard and onto US HWY 50. The transport driver did know who caused it. They provided pictures and was allowed to start their shift. The HSE Manager and Milford Operations Manager went to the site to further investigate the release and its severity. After arriving to the Milford yard it was clear that someone had loaded a tank wagon and spilled product without notifying anyone. The HSE Manager and Operations Manager looked at unit 865 and it was clear the truck had an overfill and product had spilled over top of it. Th truck had fuel staining on the tanker and on the front/back of the it.  HSE and Operations spoke with both night drivers and confirmed who used unit 865. When speaking with driver that used 865, they stated that they did not know about or caused any spill. The driver had started their shift at 17:30 on 10/17/2024. Footage was pulled from the truck camera system in order to determine the cause of the release. Camera footage showed the driver loading from 06:00 pm to around 06:35 pm. Camera footage showed the driver causing a spill of diesel from the truck after loading. It showed the driver pulling out of the loading bay and then back in the loading bay spilling product. Next, the driver gets out to look at the truck top, then gets back in the truck and backs out of loading bay and pulls around circling in the yard. Then, parks 10 feet away from a storm drain at the facility while product is still being released to the ground from the truck top. Next, the driver gets out and looks at the spill. During this time the driver does not take any action to stop or slow the spill nor did they report it to HSE or Operations. The driver was not following procedures and neglected to take any actions addressing the spill. Finally, the driver walks into the office building, comes back out and proceeds to leave the yard. When doing so more diesel is spilled. The majority of diesel is spilled in the facility yard. The driver turns right (west) onto US HWY 50. Product splashes off the truck onto the road way for several hundred yards. The driver finished his shift, returned to the yard and parked the truck back at the Milford Facility without reporting the release.  Approximately 30 gallons of diesel fuel was spilled. HEPACO was contacted on 10/18/2024 at 04:57 and was dispatched to clean up the spill. One storm drain was impacted at the WFS facility and the diesel fuel was contained to the catch basin and recovered. Weather conditions were dry and there was no precipitation. On 10/18/2024 between 07:56 and 12:31 the NRC, Ohio EPA, Clermont Co. EMA, and Miami TWP Fire Dept. were notified of the spilled. Diesel that spilled on to US HWY 50 was not cleaned up and no roadway safety issues were reported. HEPACO finished the","World Fuel Service, Inc. (WFS) reviews and investigates all incidents to determine root cause and what corrective actions need to be implemented to prevent any reoccurrences. The spill occurred because of a human error. The WFS driver overfilled one of the tanker truck compartments during loading and did not take any actions to report, contained, or mitigate the spill. Operations personnel will be briefed on the incident during the next safety meetings and on WFS spill reporting and response requirements.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,7081,"WORLD FUEL SERVICES, INC.",US,

The release impacted trailer # 5633416. No storm drains or waterways are reported to be impacted by the release. The contractor cleaned-up the release using absorbent pads and replaced cap on the tote.

The car was isolated and the shipper, DK Trading and Supply/Cenovus, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report #2024-1024-00183). HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the car leaking from both liquid line valves and the vapor valve.  The cause of the releases was all valves being found partially open and secondary closures not secured “tool tight”.   Contractor personnel closed all valves, inspected and installed all secondary closures properly.

ERTS dispatched contractors to properly containerize the waste and separate the product from the wood chips. Contractors arrived onsite and separated the damaged pail from the wood chips. The damaged pail appeared to be punctured by a forklift blade and was containerized into a 30-gallon metal drum.

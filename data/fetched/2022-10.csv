However this is usually an indicator that the lining around the collar where the dome lid comes down is having an issue where the rubber doesn't make perfect surface contact that will need to be repaired.  Trailer is out of service pending repairs.",We have imposed a self inspection interval of every 4 months to try and catch common issues before they become a problem in transit.

I noticed it was paint materials and immediately put it in a lined bin at around 7:30am. DescribePack: Upon discovery of the package there was a distinct odor and the package itself was wet on the top of the box and some of the side and bottom. The tape that sealed it wasn't an issue to which I will elude to later. I found the contents of the package to be boat paint sealer and the cap clips that would usually hold a can of paint's cover in place were in an upward position. Unsure of how they up like that but as a result the covers on both cans of paint were slightly popped open enough for a few ounces to come out. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: Initially I grabbed a surgical mask and double gloved before going anywhere near the package and then put the damaged package into a lined black bin just in case the leaking hadn't subsided and then checked to make sure the cans were facing up as well.,No comments provided.,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Fedex Ground Package System, Inc.",US,

I found the damaged Hazmat inside a blue plastic bag that was inside an orange plastic container. Upon opening the plastic bag, I found a white package that had wet spots. No other damage was observed on package. Pictures were taken of package and of all its contents. Package contained four, 1-gallon plastic containers each filled with Master Care Triple D Medium Duty Universal Coil Cleaner. One of the containers had a loose cap and an open seal. This allowed about 5 ounces of its contents to spill inside package. Upon inspection of package, I found that the Tracking # on label (6093 3554 7638) did not match the Tracking # on the OP-900 (6093 3554 7660). However, the hazmat description and quantity on the OP-900 did match the information listed on the package. I also discovered that the hazmat package did not have the required, 4 inch per side, colored, Corrosive hazard label.  This package did not have the Hazmat certificate since it was processed on 10-05-22, at 310 BRSL. DescribePack: The outer package did not have any visible damage except for some wet spots caused by the spilled hazmat. The failure was the result of one container having a loose cap and an open seal. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: The damaged hazmat package was immediately placed in a blue plastic bag and the bag opening was tied closed.

Once they finished offloading the supplies, a third Veolia employee operating a forklift began loading five 85 gal 1H2 poly salvage drums onto the truck. Each 85 gallon salvage drum contained a compromised 55 gallon 1H1 drum containing 96% sulfuric acid. The forklift operator placed the drums on the tail end of the straight truck and the two Veolia personnel utilized a pallet jack to move the drums to the nose of the straight truck. When they went to get the the fifth drum, they noticed the 4th drum started to bulge on top. Shortly after, they noticed a mist was visible near the drum and the employees immediately exited out of the box of the straight truck. The Veolia employees observed the drum from outside of the truck and could see it was increasing in pressure and bulging. The drum eventually ruptured due to the pressure and started to release the liquid and absorbent that was placed inside the salvage drum. The total duration of the reaction and release was roughly 30 minutes and the estimated quantity of hazardous material that spilled out of the package was roughly 2 gallons.   The Veolia employees contained the spill by laying down visqueen and spill pads under the truck due to the sulfuric acid leaking through the floorboards onto the ground. They donned level B PPE and re-containerized the drum. This drum was left on the generator's site and was not shipped. Veolia employees completed the spill response and neutralized the acid that had leaked out.","After reviewing the incident, it was determined that during the salvage packaging operation, diatomaceous earth was not used but rather organic based (paper) absorbent was utilized. High concentration sulfuric acid acts like a oxidizer and likely contributed to the reaction.  In addition, it had rained two days earlier and likely humidity exacerbated the process due to water being absorbed by the organic based absorbent.   Veolia will train employees to make sure they understand the characteristics of absorbent that is being utilized. In addition, prior to purchase, Veolia will confirm that diatomaceous earth is purchased and not the paper product absorbent that was received due to the paper product resembling diatomaceous earth and can easily be confused.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

Reportedly product blew out of the top valves on the tank car. The tank car was isolated from the crews and employees in the yard.

After further inspection the tank car was equiped with a salco rupture disk component and found that surge protection was not in place. Additionally the plasteic inspection cap was broken. The shipper representative, Justin Akin, 313-626-2422 was notified of the situation found. Jr Simplot had Rescar replace the Salco rupture disk component and filed One Time Movement Approval #FRA-221110004.  This incident did require a special move.

The car was isolated and the shipper, National Response Center, and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection were notified.  (CHEMTREC Report #2022-1026-00230). Specialized Professional Services, Inc, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found an active leak from the liquid valve packing gland nut. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper, Mr. Wayne Meadows, phone 832-205-6586. Contractor personnel tightened the packing gland nut and secured the observed release. Due to weather conditions personnel were unable to confirm if the liquid valve packing gland was the only point of release, and contractor personnel returned the next day, applied 4-5 psi of air to the service equipment and observed a defective liquid valve leaking in the closed position. As of this 5800.1 report, the car remains on hold pending replacement of the defective component. This incident did not require a special switching move. 7.1 is required.

Loading facility does not allow for driver/carrier to inspect manhole covers while on shipper premises. At aprox. 1800 on 10/02/2022 I(Virgil Hatton) was driving IWS truck#77. As part of my evening duties with Nova, I was at the Sumter Rail yard, and hooked up to tanker#9410. I pulled up to the east gate where the security guard and I inspected the exterior and sides of the tanker. We were not able to inspect the top of the tanker due to lack of fall! Protection equipment After leaving the east gate, I was enroute to the Sumter Giant Resource Recovery (GRR) plant. I approched the stop sign at South Housar Str, made a complete stop, went straight for approx. 1/2 mile and made a right turn onto Brooklny St. After approx. 1/2 mile, I came to another stop sign; made a complete stop and turned right onto Fulton St At approx. 1/8 mile, I turned left onto Industrial Rd. After going another approx. 1/8 mile, as I slowed down to make a complete stop in order to turn left into the GRR plant, I glanced in my driver side mirror and saw a surge of liquid dripping down the side of the tanker. I made the left tum and, watching the driver's side mirror, saw the dome lid on top the tanker open in an upright position. I immediately stopped my truck, got out, climbed up the ladder to the top of the tanker, then I closed and Latched the dome lid. I got back in my truck, proceeded through the security gate and parked my truck at the plant. I immediately notified Nova plant supervisor Jeff and Greg. They started Spill Response at this time. After they told me there was nothing more for me to do at this time, I unhooked Tanker#9410 from my truck. I left the GRR plant, and backtracked my route from GRR plant to the rail yard to look for evidence or a spill. There was none. I called Nova supervisor Jeff to inform him there was no spill. ///End of Statement///","TO PREVENT AND ELIMINATE FUTURE OCCURANCE, IWS AND NOVA ARE NOW TRIPLE CHECKING THE MANHOLE COVERS AND VALVES FOR SECUREMENT SO THIS DOESN'T EVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

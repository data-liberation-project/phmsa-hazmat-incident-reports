HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found three of four bolts on the liquid line valve mounting flange were less than tool tight. Contractor personnel tightened the liquid line flange bolts to stop the release and decontaminated the residue material from the side of the tank car.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper’s representative (Marcelles Prather, Marcelles.Prather@Ineos.com, 251-463-6082).

The incident occurred prior to boarding in SHR. A passenger’s checked bag was loaded into the cargo pit. The ramp agent loading the bags inside the pit noticed smoke coming from the passenger’s bag. The bag was immediately removed from the aircraft and taken to a safe location.  Airport Fire and Rescue was notified and responded. Fire rescue crews neutralized the smoking bag. The passenger was then brought into a private room to speak with TSA and the station’s supervisor on duty to discuss the battery fire. According to the IOR report, it was determined, at that point, that the cause of the smoke was a charger charging what appears to be a battery tray holding possibly four 18650 lithium Ion Batteries.

I could see a flight attendant speaking with a passenger in the aisle of the B zone cabin. They were standing next to a Polaris seat with a flashlight. I immediately asked the flight attendant what was happening, and where the smell was coming from. He showed me a broken cell phone belonging to 12A Norris Dodson. From what I was told, Mr. Dodson woke sometime prior and realized his phone was no longer on his person. He notified flight attendant and asked for help in retrieving it. In the process of searching for the phone, flight attendant activated the electronic seat controls. The phone was crushed by the mechanism and the lithium battery was punctured. When I arrived at the seat, the phone was hot to the touch. There was no smoke, or any other indicator of fire. But to be safe, between the chemical smell and the heat of the phone, I decided to place the phone in the thermal containment bag.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Simplot Phosphates, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report #20240330-00051). Marion Environmental, Inc. (MEI), a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found that the release was due to a faulty pressure relief device; the vent assembly was found with no rupture disc, surge protection sleeve, or rupture disc retaining ring.  Additionally, the threads utilized for installing a rupture disc retention ring into the assembly base were broken.   MEI personnel removed the faulty pressure relief device and replaced with an in-kind assembly to temporarly secure the car.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper’s representative (Anthony Guillen 208-780-0794).

The Hazmat was toppled over when found and was leaking some of the chloride inside (solid). Package Handlers contacted an Ops Manager and informed QA/Coordinator of the incident. We removed the packaged from the vehicle and put it in a bucket to keep spilling anymore of the contents inside the station. It was taken to the Hazmat cage where upon further inspection found that the Hazmat material was inside of a plastic cylinder (outer container is a cardboard box). While transferring the leaking Hazmat, it was found that the bottom of the cylinder had cracked and was leaking a massive amount of the chlorine. The box itself was already filled halfway with the leaking contents. Admins wore protective gloves and used the ventilation shaft to not inhale the ""fumes"" of the chloride. The Hazmat was placed in a Hazmat container and DPR/ISF were filled out. DescribePack: The packaged appeared to have been repacked as it has a new label and was missing the shipping documents and had lots of tape wrapped around the closures. Looking at the photos from previous stations before it's arrival to the current one, it was in a much nicer box with better taping/packaging. The bucket likely could have been dropped at some point during it's transport casuing the bottom portion to be cracked, or likely from moving around inside the box as it did not have any filling inside to prevent the contents from moving around. The driver also could have secured the package to stop it from sliding around on the floor, perhaps had it on one of the shelves.

Upon inspection of the tractor/trailer, the trooper detected a leak coming out from under the ss skin on the bottom of the trailer just in front of the rollover protection. A tub was placed underneath the leak to contain it until the cleanup crew from Michigan Spill Response arrived on scene. After a short period of time, the leak stopped and there was only residue on the trailer. At that time, the top of the trailer was visually inspected and right above the area of the leak, there was a 3"" washout cap that had fresh residue in the area which indicated that it had leaked. When Michigan Spill Response arrived on scene, they went to the top of the trailer and determined that the front washout cap was loose. They removed the washout cap, inspected the gasket, and then secured the washout cap to the threaded connection. After replacing the cap, a surge test was conducted on site and the trailer showed no signs of of any further leakage. Michigan Spill Response cleaned the residue from the trailer and disposed of the product that was collected in the catch pan placed underneath the trailer. Once the residue was removed rom the trailer, the load continued on without further incident.

Everything had been secured prior to leaving the customer's site with ratchet straps utilizing the e-track system in the truck. The road leaving the customer site grades down hill and as the driver was coming down hill he felt the load shift in the truck. The driver stopped at the stop sign at the bottom of the hill and exited the truck only to find that there was material leading from the front side of the truck cargo box. The totes had shifted and pulled the e-track away from the side of the truck, broke the clip that goes into the e-track, and slid forward in the cargo area of the truck, pushing a pallet jack into a poly drum filled with mostly water with trace amount of solvent. A corner of the pallet jack punched a hole in the poly drum releasing the contents out into the truck cargo area which left the truck and spilled on the road.   The Veolia driver called the local Fire Department to respond to the spill. WV DEP was on scene along with a third party ER group to clean up the material left on the road. The road was closed both directions for a period of time until clean up of the road and berm soil were complete. Note that after further investigation the drum that was damaged was over 96% water with trace amounts of organic compounds.

QA detected the smell was coming from this package and noticed small amount of outer packaging appeared wet from something inside, despite no other packages on pallet being wet. Upon determination, package was placed in red, lined hazmat tote and transported to processing area. No other packages found to be affected and upon opening Hazmat package (outer packaging then internal packaging containing regulated contents) determined the internal leakage was very minimal at time, all confined within inner and outer packaging. DescribePack: A cap on one of the two regulated containers within the inner packaging came loose somehow, resulting in a small internal leak of contents inside inner packaging w/ some product eventually seeping into outer packaging as well; all leaking was determined to be confined within inner and outer packaging, none on other packages or employees. No punctures or other signs/causes of leakage on any containers in package. Amount of leakage overall was very minimal. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: The Unload team was quick to alert QA upon noticing the odor when package came off of trailer and on tugger cart. This enabled the responding QA to assess situation, place the hazmat in lined red tote, and get it moved from the sort to the hazmat processing area in a timely, safe, & efficient manner while being sure to follow necessary protocols and procedure.

I could see a flight attendant speaking with a passenger in the aisle of the B zone cabin. They were standing next to a Polaris seat with a flashlight. I immediately asked the flight attendant what was happening, and where the smell was coming from. He showed me a broken cell phone belonging to 12A Norris Dodson. From what I was told, Mr. Dodson woke sometime prior and realized his phone was no longer on his person. He notified flight attendant and asked for help in retrieving it. In the process of searching for the phone, flight attendant activated the electronic seat controls. The phone was crushed by the mechanism and the lithium battery was punctured. When I arrived at the seat, the phone was hot to the touch. There was no smoke, or any other indicator of fire. But to be safe, between the chemical smell and the heat of the phone, I decided to place the phone in the thermal containment bag.

The employee reported the observation to the Transportation Manager who in turn initiated an emergency response from the CN Dangerous Goods Team. The on duty Dangerous Goods Officer dispatched an emergency response contractor to the yard to investigate. The responding contractor's initial observation found product residue on both sides of the tank car. Further assessment revealed that all (6) manway cover swing bolts were less than tool tight (could turn by hand) with (1) of the swing bolts in the down position causing a leak from the manway cover due to an improper seal of the gasket. The shipper security seal was found to be intact. The shipper manway cover security seal was removed and the cover was opened for the purpose of replacing the gasket. The manway cover swing bolts were then tightened in a star pattern utilizing an 18"" pipe wrench.

When they hook up they are to do a twist test on the hose to make sure it doesn't spin at all.  Any movement indicates either the gasket is bad or the camlocks that lock it down may need to be shimmed.  It did not twist when he tried moving it and the gaskets all looked good.  After he applied shims though it did stop the leak.  We're taking this hose out of use going forward and getting it back to the manufacturer so they can inspect it and replace the fitting on the end.  8 ounces hit the ground beyond the spill bucket.,I do not believe any changes are needed for this event.

HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the container leaking from the door seam.  It was presumed the release was due to a combination of an ineffective door seem and either a failure, or improper installation, of the box’s poly ethylene liner.  Contractor personnel secured the package by applying additional sealant to the rear door of the container.

Upon arrival, contractors investigated and confirmed the release was caused by a load shift due to a hard brake and was contained to the trailer floor and a 100ft x 6ft area of asphalt trailing behind the unit. Contractors neutralized the release then used absorbents and the proper PPE to clean the release. Contractors were able to transfer the remaining product in the damaged tote to a new tote without complication. All waste generated from addressing this release was containerized in (7) 55-gallon DF’s, which was then taken offsite by contractors for proper disposal. **The NRC report has the city of Beaumont (which the spill took place in Orange City), this 5800 report was completed to match the NRC report for fluidity**",No comments provided,Yes,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,41500,"EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND TRAINING SOLUTIONS, INCORPORATED",US,

The delivery's inception; TransMontaigne Terminal on 3450 Jefferson Road, Athens, GA 30607 loading of Metroplex Energy. In route to the delivery on Highway 53 @ Hoyt Holder Road heading North, in Braselton, GA. Mr. Bell failed to maintain his lane of travel and rolled his tractor trailer. Mr. Bell stated, there were three vehicles in front of him traveling approximately 25 mph, and another vehicle turning right (South) from Hoyt Holder Road causing him to move toward the right shoulder. This movement brought Mr. Bells tires off the road and onto the soft, muddy shoulder. As Mr. Bell brought his tractor back onto the roadway the trailer entered a drop off area that turned the unit over. The tractor trailer rolled completely over with the tractor blocking both sides of Hwy 53, and the trailer positioned upside down arched between the road and the drop off area, slanting down about eight feet. Fortunately, Mr. Bell was able to evacuate the vehicle sustaining no injuries. Once out of the unit, Mr. Bell secured the scene making sure there were no hazardous materials compromising the environment. Jackson County Sheriff's Office and Fire Department were dispatched to the scene of the accident. GA DOT also was present to close Highway 53 off and to verify the hazardous cargo was not compromising the environment. GA DOT officer MCO Fortson conducted a DOT inspection on the vehicle following the FMCSA-inspection Platform (Driver/Vehicle Examination Report). Seymour's Towing and Recovery responded to the emergency for remediation and recovery. Team Logistics Emergency Team brought another tanker truck to transfer products. After conducting a safety briefing, a plan was put into place. The Jackson County Fire Department evacuated the three residents near the accident location for two hours during the transfer of product for safety, then set up a foam and water deployment location. Seymour's grounded and bonded the tanker for transfer, then secured the rolled unit with two wreckers.","We wer-e then able to remove the bottom belly valves from the trailer to transfer the product safely. During the removal of the belly valves, approximately thirty-five gallons of gasoline were released into a protective berm containing booms and absorbents constructed before the transfer. Once all products were transferred, the tractor trailer was prepared for removal. Highway 53 was closed for five hours while the work was being conducted.  Further actions: Due to the inclement weather, polymer was placed over the impacted area and will be remediated by the weekend of March 22. Seymour's will be overseeing the remediation and disposal of all contaminated soil.

These 11 packages(see image below) did not include any of the DG markings or labels we train associates to detect(per ROC), but WFS nonetheless spotted and sidelined them. Had the packages not been sidelined, they would have been loaded onto ATI flight ATN3313(KSEA-PANC). The packages were non-AFN cargo, tendered and packaged by the shipper, Pitney Bowes. The sidelined packages in KSEA were opened to determine the exact content/product. All 11 of them contained Section Il lithium batteries in equipment, such as an ear cleaner, headsets, desk lamp, diving lamp. Of the 11, three were not labeled correctly: they contained rriultiple battery powered products, exceeding the two battery cell allowance for labeling exception. As a result, we consider these three packages to be undeclared DG, despite that they were not ultimately flown. Additionally, five of the 11 packages were packaged incorrectly: they were in a poly bag, not the corrugate box required by IATA PI 967/970.

The driver met with the customer site operator, completed the “In the Interest of Safety Form” (which is a form utilized by OxyChem truck drivers to ensure that enough space exists in a customer tank prior to unloading), hooked up offloading hoses, and began offloading. Near the end of the offloading process, product began to overflow from the customer's storage tank into the containment area. The OxyChem truck driver immediately shut down the offloading process. The customer site operator was present with the driver when the overflow occurred and made a comment that they would have to check the tank level indicator for accuracy because the calculation during the completion of the “In the Interest of Safety Form” showed that there was sufficient capacity available within the storage tank. Customer site personnel washed down the area. The spill was estimated to be approximately 75-gallons. No injuries, property damage, or environmental impact as a result of the incident.",The OxyChem truck driver immediately shut down the offloading operation and notified customer site operators. The area was washed down and cleaned up. Occidental Chemical Tech Service group has been requested to reach out to the customer site to discuss necessary corrections that are needed moving forward to prevent a re-occurrence.

During the cruise phase of flight, a passenger's charging device(identified as a Cobra CPP8000 external lithium ion battery pack) began to smoke as a lithium battery runaway situation developed. The device was initially located within the passenger's carry-on backpack underneath the seat in front of them. Upon noticing the smoke, the passenger reached into their backpack for the battery pack and received second degree bums to their hands. The Inflight crew in partnership with a deadheading Breeze Captain suppressed the smoking device with water and utilized the onboard PED kit to contain the device. The flight diverted to KABQ out of an abundance of caution where it landed safely and was met by fire/EMS upon arrival at the gate. No evacuation was required and passengers were deplaned normally. The passenger who received burns was treated at the scene by EMS and released.",Breeze's investigation found that all company processes and procedures were followed onboard the aircraft during the event. Some future actions to be taken are that the company will do its best to ensure that any devices that experience a thermal runway or quarantined under the control of the company upon arrival until the completion of any investigation.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,ZZ,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,BREEZE AIRWAYS,US,

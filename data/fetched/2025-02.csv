The car was isolated and BASF Corporation were notified via CHEMTREC (Report #2025022400160). HEPACO, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found a small drip coming from the bottom outlet area. Contractor personnel were not able to stop the leak and therefor drained remaining residue from the tank car.

The employee removed a 275 gallon IBC tote from the trailer using a forklift and placed it on the ground. The employee then went to grab the next pallet, and as he was placing it down, he noticed a small stain of liquid on the ground underneath the tote. Upon noticing that liquid was dripping onto the ground, the employee grabbed absorbent pads and placed it around the tote to prevent the spill from spreading. Approximately two ounces of hazardous waste liquid spilled within the two minutes it took to control the spill. The material in the tote was transferred to another tote using a gravity feed. It was determined that the leak originated from the  bottom of the tote since there was no evidence of visible damage to any other part of the tote. However, since the tote was inside a cage, it was not possible to pinpoint the exact location of the hole on the bottom of the tote.",Veolia will review this incident with all field service employees involved in handling hazardous material during the monthly safety meeting. Veolia employees who are involved in handling totes will be notified/trained to verify the integrity of totes. The integrity of all hazmat containers must be evaluated prior to handling to ensure that there are no deficiencies that can lead to a chemical release.,No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

Driver was at the back of the trailer and did not notice it right away and when it was noticed the pump was shut down and absorbent wer put down to contain the material. The material was released onto pavement and no drains were affected. There was approximately 10 gallons released and a team was dispatched to perform the clean up. They were notified at 1545et and arrived at 1745et. Once they arrived they assessed the scene and began a plan for the clean up. PPE was dawned and the clean up began at 1830et. The material had frozen due to the extreme cold which helped prevent the material from spreading. The team used shovels and absorbents to collect the material and dispose of in the proper containers. The clean up was completed at 2030et.,It was is believed that water in the material froxxse in the check valve in the exhaust of the pump due to the extreme cold preventing the check valve from closing preventing the material from escaping.

The screw appeared to come from a loose panel in the back of the truck. A Veolia employee cleaned up the spill and notified Veolia EH&S.  The hole was in the side of the jerrican facing the wall of the truck. A loose board had two screws sticking out of it. One the the screws punctured the jerrican and caused a leak.  Duration of the release was about 15 minutes. A little less than half the contents leaked out of the jerrican.  Employees overpacked the jerrican into another container and cleaned up the liquid that spilled inside the truck.",Veolia employees will be retrained to check cargo areas for any defects such as loose bolts prior to loading waste into vehicles.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Shintech Louisiana LLC, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report #2025-0204-00181). HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and observed dried residue on the exterior of the car which appeared to have released from the tank car’s pressure relief valve. No active leaks or apparent defects were observed.  HEPACO personnel decontaminated the exterior of the tank car.  All actions were communicated to the shipper’s representative (Patrick Hill).

Clean Harbors personnel observed that the released material impacted 30 ft-by-30 ft area of dock floor concrete. Clean Harbors personnel deployed granular absorbents to the impacted area and containerized them into three (3) 55-gallon poly drums. The remaining material in the product tote was to be transferred to a new 330-gallon IBC tote. However, both pumps cleaned harbors brought were faulty. They had obtained a functional pump from a local supplier and began pumping out the material. Work was paused to obtain upgraded PPE. After obtaining the correct PPE, personnel were able to complete the tote transfer. The incident generated a total of six (6) containers. One (1) 55-gallon poly drum contains two (2) 330-gallon poly tote bladders (cut up), Poly sheeting, and PPE. One (1) 55-gallon poly drum contains a diaphragm pump rinse water. One (1) 330-gallon tote contains the original product. Three (3) 55-gallon poly drums contain absorbent debris.

Tires on passenger side of trailer entered soft shoulder causing trailer to roll. There were no 3rd parties, no injuries, and some damage to barbwire fence and street sign. Crisis Center was notified and activated. Local Vehicle Recovery Teams from Galt and Santa Clara have responded to the scene. Local fire department responded to scene. Corporate Safety and Environmental notified. Our Air Products driver arrived at the scheduled delivery location with a fully loaded Nitrogen trailer when he approached a gate. The driver exited his vehicle and quickly determined he was at the wrong location. Upon returning to his vehicle, he decided to perform a U-Turn on a narrow two-lane road which had an incline. During the maneuvering, the back end of the trailer dug into soft shoulder and mud, the weight of the trailer pushed the tractor which caused the trailer to break away from the 5th wheel and roll against the tractor. The trailer then rolled over onto its side across the roadway. The trailer released liquid Nitrogen due to the PSV line being damaged. During the roll over event, the tractor’s fuel tank was ruptured causing a diesel spill onto the ground. There were no injuries reported, and no other vehicles involved in this incident.","Provide further focused training on basic procedures and what to do in critical situations.

Driver over corrected causing the trailer to sway, then rollover. Unit remained on roadway and no other vehicles were involved. This trailer consisted of 4 compartments. The last compartment received a puncture spilling 2,000 gals. of ULSD B2. The product ran down the roadway and entered storm drains that discharged rain fall into Pine Creek. Pine Creek discharges into The Allegheny River approximately 1 /2 mile downstream from the spill. The duration of the release was immediate & flowed freely until fire department was on scene. The trailer was an aluminum MC 306 built by Custom in the year 1995.  Multiple fire departments were on scene along with the PA State Police, Allegheny County Hazmat, Etna Baro Police and others. On initial impact a fire started from product spilled along the barrier wall when contacted and ruptured. The fire department extinguished with no incident. The driver exited from the cab on his own, transported to ER and released with no injuries other than a cut on his hand. The fire departments blocked the drains with booms and other material to stop any continuous flow that could occur. A HM Spill Contractor was called to remove the remaining ULSD from the other 3 compartments. The trailer needed to be drilled to install a pump out hose into the tank. Product was transferred without further incident. The contractor was completing cleanup while the action of pumping the trailer was done. After the truck was righted and removed from the scene under tow, the contractor continued with the cleanup under the supervision of the PennDOT responder. Fire crews installed booms in the creek and at the mouth where the creek empties into the Allegheny River. The creek and river are an ongoing project to retain and remove product. Multiple state and local agencies are involved in monitoring the spill cleanup actions.","The steps we are taking to prevent this type of incident are immediate. First, we have been in business for over 50 years, and we take any incident very seriously. In this case, I have notified the whole company via email to all terminals and to all drivers via their ELD messaging system. The Risk department is currently showing the video of this incident to all drivers face to face. The video is already having a major impact on our drivers that have watched the video. We are focused and committed on specialized training to establish a completely safe culture. In this case, reinforcing the importance of distraction free driving. We recognize that most preventable incidents are due to human error and an;? not mechanical errors. We have immediately increased our drivers' observations. Our Lead Driver Trainers will also use this incident to talk about distracted driving during training .",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,165400,"PENN TANK LINES, INC.",US,

While transferring containers onto a truck, the worker utilized a drum dolly to transport a 55-gallon polyethylene drum. Upon setting the drum down inside the vehicle, the employee observed approximately one pint of clear liquid pooling around the drum's base.  Further inspection revealed a small hole at the bottom of the drum, which was the source of the leak. To contain and manage the spill, the worker promptly employed vermiculite and absorbent pads. These materials effectively prevented the liquid from spreading and facilitated the cleanup process.  To ensure safe transportation to the intended facility, the compromised drum was placed inside an overpack container. This additional precaution allowed for the secure continuation of the drum's journey to its final destination.",Veolia will review this incident with employees to remind them to inspect the condition of all containers prior to moving them and to be aware of the force used when setting down a drum on a drum dolly.,No,DRUM NON-METAL,Plastic drum,DRUM PLS,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

Contractors were dispatched to the site to perform all onsite clean-up activities. Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of approximately 25.0 gallons of Vydate C-LV (UN2991, 6.1 (3), II) from (1) 275-gal poly tote onto the trailer floor and asphalt. The release was reportedly due to the tote’s securement strap gouging the top of the poly tote bladder causing a release in transit, impacting multiple areas of the trailer floor and asphalt. No drains or waterways were impacted by the release. The release was cleaned up with absorbents and the proper PPE. Contractors transferred the remaining product from the damaged tote to a new tote to continue on to the consignee. The damaged tote was shredded and containerized by the contractors. All waste generated from addressing this release was containerized in (2) 55-gallon DF which were left offsite by the contractor for proper disposal.",no comment provided,No,                             ,,,No,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,12000,"EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND TRAINING SOLUTIONS, INCORPORATED",US,

Safety contacted Mattisyn Keys with Cura for remediation. ~~Safety advised Mattisyn Keys to advise Safety if any struck the yard and if the spill becomes reportable. Safety also requested the cause of the spill.  ~~Update from Cura- ""It took some time to get a contractor to respond earlier this morning. The crew just wrapped up at the terminal, completing removal of the environmental concern. The drums looked to have been compressed inside the trailer, causing the release.

Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of 35.0 gallons of Dynasylan® SILBOND® 40 (UN1993, 3, III) from (1) 55-gallon metal drum onto the trailer floor and asphalt. The release was reportedly due to a load shift, impacting (4) wooden pallets on the trailer floor and a 3’ x 3’ area of asphalt. No drains or waterways were impacted by the release. Contractors found that the release was evaporated by the time they arrived on site. With the proper PPE, contractors removed the (1) leaking drum and placed it into an overpack, then removed (5) damaged drums from the pallets to be reviewed by the client for disposition.

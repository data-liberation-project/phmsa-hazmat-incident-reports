CPKC Hazmat Department mobilized to the ramp, along with a response contractor, to mitigate the release. Upon arrival, responders found all security seals in place. A small stream of liquid was emanating from the bottom outlet valve secondary closure cap, which was found hand tight. The primary closure""butterfly"" valve was found slightly open. Additionally, the Internal bottom outlet valve's security seal was applied in such a way as to prevent the valve from fully closing. The crew tightened the secondary closure cap on the bottom outlet valve and secured the primary closure""butterfly"" valve to stop the release. Due to the nature of the product, responders elected to make shipper notification and request permission to remove the security seals in order to determine the extent of the product lost. On 9/13/2024, permission was received from the shipper to remove the security seals. The crew returned to IFG to complete investigation. Upon return, the manway was opened to inspect outage on CXTU101946. All manway bolts were found loose. The Iadlng outage was approximately 2 feet. Estimate for Iading release is 40 gallons. The secondary closure cap was removed and found with a defective gasket. Responders replaced the gasket. The cap was installed tool tight and security seal installed in the closed position. Also, the internal bottom outlet valve security seal that was holding the valve in the partially open position was removed and a new security seal was properly installed holding the valve In the closed position. No security seals were removed from the butterfly valve, but an additional security seal was properly installed to hold this valve in the closed position. Once secured, CXTU101946 was released back into transportation. Additional DOT Cause Code: What Failed: 121, How Failed: 308, Cause of Failure: 508. File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated based on the best Information available at the time of filing. This shipment was offered as a'bulk' shipment, aka one car loads therefore the exact amount offered in this package is not known to the carrier. This carrier does not have access to mass balance data which can exactly quantify this value.","The Kansas City Southern Railway(KCSR)(DBA CPKC) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases(NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases(a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a rootcause Investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCSR.(Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Carl Akins, KCSR Railway, P.O.

Toward the end of loading, a high-level probe should have stopped the pump and prevented over-filling of the truck. The probe was tripped, but the automatic valve responded more slowly than optimal resulting in a spill of about 10 gallons(100-lbs) that flowed down the side of the truck on to the truck loading pad, and then toward the secondary'containment ditch to the east of the pad. The truck and loading pad were washed down with water Into the containment ditch. From there, it drained into a sump and was conveyed by an in-place submersible pump to a recycle storage tank. Investigation found that the high-level probe triggered immediately on contact with the solution, but that the automatic valve closed slowly, and that the truck tank had a taller than usual dome-lid extension.","A more responsive automatic valve has been ordered and received, and will be installed in the near future.

This shipment was offered as a'bulk' shipment, aka one car load, therefore the exact amount offered in this package is not known to the carrier. This carrier does not have access to mass balance data which can exactly quantify this value. On September 10, 2024, Daniel Perkins, FRA Hazmat Inspector, conducted an inspection at the CPKC Muskego Yard in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. During inspection of tank car TILX 318532, Mr. Perkins observed wetness inside the interior of the protective housing. The wetness evaporated instantly. Further examination revealed that that four of four liquid valve flange nuts were loose which allowed for vapor to release from the assembly. A CPKC Contractor responded to the incident and was able to tighten the fiange nuts, stopping the leak.","The SOO LINE RAILROAD COMPANY(DBA CPI(C) notified shipper of this release.

An employee was using a drum picker to load a drum onto a trailer when the situation occurred. As the drum was being maneuvered into position, it inadvertently made contact with the side of the trailer. Upon impact, it was discovered that a sharp piece of metal protruding from the trailer's side had punctured the drum, resulting in a dime-sized hole. The employee immediately noticed the damage and the subsequent leak. It was estimated that approximately two gallons of the drum's contents had spilled as a result of the puncture.","This incident highlights the importance of regular equipment inspections and the need for careful handling during transfer operations.

(OSI) is the operating contractor for Holston Army Ammunition  Plant (HSAAP) located at 4509 West Stone Drive in Kingsport, Hawkins County, Tennessee. On  September 13, 2024 a hose rupture during offload of a strong nitric acid tanker resulted in a  release of acid to the environment. A description of the event is outlined below:  The truck driver and operators started the transfer and then moved to observe from a safe location  per standard operating procedure. Approximately 10 minutes after the transfer started, personnel  observed a NOx cloud and nitric acid spray coming from the back of the tanker. After the wind  shifted, the driver made the decision to approach the tanker and activate the emergency stop,  ending the release. Upon further investigation after the incident, personnel found the transfer  hose had failed.  The total amount of nitric acid released from the tanker was 20,988 pounds. It is estimated that  approximately 10,494 pounds of nitric acid drained to the spill basin for the tanker pad and into  the wastewater collection system. Approximately 10,494 pounds sprayed onto the ground next to the  tanker pad. None of the nitric acid traveled to the stormwater channels. Approximately 105 pounds  of NOx was released during the event. A hazmat contractor was promptly hired to clean up the release.",BAE Systems is working with the supplier to define an improved process to ensure adequate hoses of the appropriate materials of construction are used for all transfers moving forward.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,200,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,76044,BAE SYSTEMS ORDNANCE SYSTEMS INC.,US,

The OxyChem Response Team responded and temporarily secured the dome to prevent leakage during movement to a nearby truck repair facility. The OxyChem Response team then replaced the dome gasket, which resolved the issue. The LA State Police Hazmat was notified. There are no injuries, exposures, damage, or environmental impact.","During the response, it was discovered the dome gasket was missing. Further investigation revealed that the customer site on the previous delivery this trailer was used on had opened the dome hatch to retrieve a product sample. This is where we believe the dome gasket went missing. The trailer is currently being washed and dried so that an internal inspection can be done to determine if the dome gasket fell off into the tank during the previous delivery.  In the meantime, OxyChem Technical Service group has reached out to this customer site to request that they no longer open the dome lids of OxyChem trailers for numerous reasons. Further actions are being discussed to determine accountability measures of the above request.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,OCCIDENTAL CHEMICAL CORPORATION,US,

Among the items were two 5-gallon pails containing lithium-ion batteries. The Veolia team carefully inspected each battery to ensure there was no bulging or damage, and verified that the terminals were properly protected with tape.  The following morning, as Veolia employees were unloading waste from a box truck for trans-loading at Veolia's intransit facility, one worker noticed smoke emanating from one of the pails containing lithium-ion batteries. Acting swiftly, the employee removed the smoking 5-gallon pail from the truck and isolated it outdoors. The affected battery was allowed to complete its reaction process safely.  Subsequently, the remaining batteries were separated and thoroughly re-examined. As a precautionary measure, each lithium-ion battery was individually bagged, and packed with fire suppressant media. Following this incident, all lithium-ion batteries were treated as damaged or defective and packaged in accordance with the 49 CFR 173.185(f) regulations. The second pail of lithium batteries underwent the same rigorous re-examination and packaging process to ensure safety and compliance.","Following the incident, a thorough investigation was conducted. The findings revealed that the battery in question had several wires with compromised insulation. This damage allowed exposed sections of the wires to come into contact with one another, potentially causing a short circuit and triggering the battery's reaction.  In response to this event, Veolia has committed to taking the following actions:  1. Conduct a comprehensive review of the incident with all relevant employees. 2. Implement additional training to emphasize the importance of inspecting wiring conditions on batteries. 3. Reinforce existing lithium battery shipping guidelines through refresher courses for all staff involved in handling and transporting these materials.  These measures aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure the continued safe handling and transportation of lithium batteries.",No,                             ,,,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

Upon discovery, the trailer was promptly relocated to a loading dock for further inspection and handling. During the offloading process, it was determined that a drum within the trailer had sustained damage. Specifically, a nail puncture had created a pinhole leak at the bottom of the drum. As a result of this damage, approximately one gallon of liquid had escaped.  Upon conducting a thorough investigation into the incident, the root cause of the leak was identified. It was discovered that the drum had been compromised due to a structural issue with its supporting pallet. Specifically, a nail was found to be protruding from the pallet on which the drum had been placed. This protruding nail had punctured the bottom of the drum during transit or handling, creating the pinhole leak that led to the subsequent fluid release.  Immediate action was taken to address the situation. The compromised drum was placed into an overpack container to prevent any additional leakage. Concurrently, a thorough clean-up operation was conducted to remove all spilled liquid from the affected area, ensuring no residual contamination remained.",The finding highlights the importance of careful inspection of pallets used in the transportation and storage of hazardous materials.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Brenntag Mid-South, was notified via CHEMTREC Report #2022-0908-00237.  HEPACO, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to investigate and found a vapor release from the tank car’s left side vapor line valve. Contractor personnel found product leaking through the valve while in the closed positon and the secondary closure plug not containing the release.  Contractor personnel tightened the secondary closure plug to stop the release.

ERTS dispatched HEPACO for all onsite clean up operations. On September 16, 2022, at 0705 ET, HEPACO arrived onsite and determined there were two punctures  approximately 1/2-inch in diameter and 2-inches by 3-inches in the tanker.  The New Pittsburgh Fire Department removed the driver from the truck and sprayed  fire fighting foam for suppression. Following the transfer of approximately 1,913-gallons of natural gasoline from the damaged tanker to a relief tanker, an estimated 6,887-gallons was released.  HEPACO reported one impacted storm drain that runs perpendicular to roadway-underneath the east bound lane to the south. The Fire Department installed absorbent boom for precautionary measure, no impacts to surface water. The truck and tanker were removed from the median.   HEPACO reported a 100-feet (ft.) by 6-ft. area of median soils and a 250-ft. by between 3 and 8-ft. width of shoulder ditch soils at drain outfall were impacted by the release. HEPACO reported a storm drain that was impacted located in the median and inspected the outfall, located to the south-east bound lane roadway, and found evidence of soil impacts. HEPACO utilized pads to absorb impacts at outfall followed by a high-pressure line jetter/vacuum truck unit from surface drain inside of catch basin and piping system to clean and recover approximately 200-gallons of liquids with vacuum truck. HEPACO utilized absorbent booms and pads in the impacted soil areas, storm drain and outfall to recover impacts, and replaced absorbents for preventative and containment measures pending monitoring and remedial activities (soil excavation). HEPACO collected and containerized all solid waste (absorbents) in a 55-gallon steel drum and transported offsite for disposal.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,193000,ERTS,US,

One or more of the paint cans leaked and it is believed that at some point the liner was also punctured during the packing process.  The puncture allowed the leaking paint to seep out of the cubic yard box and onto the trailer floor.  The spill was approximately 1 gallon of paint which was cleaned up with oil dry and the cubic yard box was unpacked and repackaged.","The employees that were part of packing the container were retrained on the process of properly packing paint cans into a cubic yard box. This included how to stack the cans, check for leaks and make sure the lids are secure.

After completion of load and shipping documents, driver departed facility for Envirite of OH for offload. A long the route, driver stopped at gas station to use restroom and grab breakfast. When he was checking out, the attendant asked if he was in tanker and that is was leaking (a small hole had developed on the driver side rear of the tanker). Driver immediately went to the truck and deployed spill kit (additional grabbed material from gas station). Driver then made call to Emergency # listed on manifest. A resulting call back stated that a tanker/crew would be coming to assist with offload. County FD arrived on scene and driver provided them copy of manifest and ERG book. FD contacted Utility Commission to bring in dirt/sand to contain the area directly around the tank.  A call was made by operations to US Ecology (EQ) to see if they were mobilizing their tanker down to the site to assist (they did not receive any call). It was later determined that the ER # listed on the manifest was for the generator and they had no means to assist. Several emergency response vendors/Industrial vendors in the area were contacted and Hepaco ended up being the quickest to get on scene.","The release is still currently under investigation.

No one found these bottles on the truck. I am not sure if there was 4 for sure but the weight is off by almost half what it should be so it leads m to believe this was damaged in the last station and the missing bottles may be there.

The driver noticed the leak while inspecting the trailer at the Love’s Truck Stop in Rayne, LA.  Less than a cup is believed to have leaked and was contained.  Groendyke dispatched a contractor to the site with hopes of correcting the problem but they were unable to stop the leak thereby requiring the trailer to be transloaded. At the State Trooper's request, the trailer was moved to parking lot of an adjacent terminal. State Trooper Wiltz requested a call back from an Eastman subject matter expert with detail knowledge of the material. Two plant employees were able to provide the required information. The transloading was completed at 6:15 pm. The trailer has been taken to the carrier terminal and will be returned to the plant as soon as an appointment is provided. There were no injuries related to this incident.","Joint RCFA investigation between VSP Technologies and Groendyke Transport found hardware failure and possible previous process failures causing a loss of clamping force to the gasketed flange connection.    Preventative Measures taken: 1) All flange/sump connection flanges need to have the ""Class Rating"" of the hardware verified, or changed out to confirm proper hardware. 2) Working on a kit program whereas all hardware, gaskets, etc. for a proper joint connection are supplied together as a kit. 3) Training of personnel by the manufacturer as to the proper equipment, installation, and torque processes in order to ensure a leak-free connection.

He notified the remaining crew to remain in the locomotive and await further instruction. This was at approximately 15: 15 hrs. The conductor notified a senior BSOR employee of the situation and a call was place at approximately 15:22 to Patrick Connors, CMO and train operation manager. A call was also placed to Steve Meyers, FRA for guidance. It was decided to have the conductor call the Chemtrec emergency response center. (Chemtrec Report #2022090706314) Patrick Connors began making calls to BSOR management and the shipper to begin a response plan, as well as the NRC and NYSDOT. Delays in making direct contact to the shipper resulted in a decision being made to contact a contractor to respond immediately to the location. A call was placed to the Norfolk Southern Yardmaster and MTO to alert them of the situation and its location. Train operations were halted on the adjoining track. The contractor arrived at the location at approximately 17:20. The contractor metered the air quality and inspected the car. They opened the protective housing lid and found the 8-side liquid line frozen with a visible vapor leak of propane. they also observed the secondary plug on the liquid line was not tool-tight, with peeling thread tape. They tightened the plug, but noticed the leak did not cease even after being tool-tight. They then relieved plug pressure by purging frozen materials, and resealed the valve. and at 18:30 noted the leak had ceased. At 1845 hrs, the wiped down the plug and valve threads, applied new thread tape to the secondary plug and used a Multi-Rae multi meter and soapy water solution to verify that the valve was closed. Pat Connors of the BSOR called all the contacted parties to advise them of the containment of the release.

During this time the NRC, VEOC were also notified. DEQ contacted Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) to dispatch the Safety Patrol Operator to evaluate need for traffic control and a lane closure was put into place. The initial incident report to the NRC indicated it could be chlorine tabs gasing off (Incident Report# 1346219). Once the hazmat crew was on scene and load was transferred to another trailer. A leaking drum of nitric acid was discovered. Ms Herman updated her NRC incident report under (Incident Report # 1346275) to show 10 gallons of nitric acid/nickel solution was released.

Initially, the employee did not see any damaged or wet boxes, so he proceeded to break down the pallet to inspect each box. After breaking down the pallet, a wet Questar box (141G) was discovered. Veolia estimates approximately one quart of liquid was released during the spill, most of which was absorbed by the fiber box. It appears that a bottle of allyl bromide broke in transit leading to the saturation of the box and release of liquid. The small amount of liquid that was released outside of the fiber box remained on the pallet under the box. The leaking box and spill pads used to clean up the spill were overpacked together for continued transportation to the final disposal facility.",Veolia's safety manager will remind the team that when shipping a package containing inner containers of liquid material a sufficient amount of vermiculite or spill dry should be used to cushion the inner containers during transportation. The vermiculite or spill dry must be in a quantity that will be able to absorb the entire contents of the liquid material. The proper amount of cushioning should be used to ensure glass bottles do not break as a truck or trailer travels down the road.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

Upon the contractor’s arrival, personnel observed that the released material impacted a 5ft-by-5ft area of the trailer floor and a 2ft-by-2ft area of asphalt yard.  Lone Star Hazmat Response personnel estimated that  five (5) gallons of material was released due to  loose caps on almost  all the 1-gallon plastic jugs on the pallet. Lone Star Hazmat Response personnel removed all the plastic jugs from the cardboard packaging and verified that all the  jugs were impacted from the pallet.  Lone Star Hazmat Response deployed Sodium Bicarbonate to neutralize the impacted areas and then placed down Oil Dri as an absorbent. The spent material was gathered and placed into two 55-gallon poly drums along with the impacted cardboard. The impacted 1-gallon plastic jugs were containerized into two 95-gallon poly drums and two (2) 55-gallon poly drums.

The hazmat package was slightly leaking so it was placed in a hazardous materials tote and taken to the hazmat processing area for further inspection. Spill was very miniscule as the fiberboard absorbed majority of the liquid. DescribePack: The outside of the package is labeled ""CONTAINS 12 - 1 LITERS"" but inside the package were only 4 - 1 Liter plastic bottles with no other packaging material to prevent movement. The amount of empty space and room for bottles to move about during transit caused a lid on one of the 1-Liter bottles to open, resulting in 1/2 liter spill from the inside of the box. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: The manager who lifted the trailer door and unloaded the package immediately let QA personnel know and put the strong smelling package in a tote away from the area.

QA took the time to look around the area for any residue to clean it up off the surface(s). Using a cart the damaged package was wheeled over to the QA station in unload.

One bolt was missing a nut (found on the pressure plate), one nut was loose.  Crew attempted to tighten without stopping the leak.  The crew re-entered and loosened the flange, the leak did not worsen so the flange was removed.  Product was on top of the ball valve and was swirling.  The gasket had a depressed area and was changed out.  The flange was tightened, and the leak continued.  The liquid valve was cycled several times and the flange removed.  The product was no longer moving.  The gasket was flipped over, flange tightened, and the leak stopped.  Upon arrival of the shipper, the flange was removed, the product was removed off the ball valve, filled with water, and ensured the ball valve was secured with no releases.

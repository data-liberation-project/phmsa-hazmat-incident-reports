Upon further assessment and opening the housing cover, liquid was visibly releasing from between the valve and the 4-bolt flanged cover plate.  One bolt was missing a nut (found on the pressure plate), one nut was loose.  Crew attempted to tighten without stopping the leak.  The crew re-entered and loosened the flange, the leak did not worsen so the flange was removed.  Product was on top of the ball valve and was swirling.  The gasket had a depressed area and was changed out.  The flange was tightened, and the leak continued.  The liquid valve was cycled several times and the flange removed.  The product was no longer moving.  The gasket was flipped over, flange tightened, and the leak stopped.  Upon arrival of the shipper, the flange was removed, the product was removed off the ball valve, filled with water, and ensured the ball valve was secured with no releases.  No releases were observed, no liquid emitted from the ball valve.  A new Teflon gasket was installed, the flange resecured, and the car diverted back to origination.",Ensure that the car is properly secured and ready for release into transportation.,Yes,,,111S100A,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,29000,Union Pacific Railroad,US,

Initially, the employee did not see any damaged or wet boxes, so he proceeded to break down the pallet to inspect each box. After breaking down the pallet, a wet Questar box (141G) was discovered. Veolia estimates approximately one quart of liquid was released during the spill, most of which was absorbed by the fiber box. It appears that a bottle of allyl bromide broke in transit leading to the saturation of the box and release of liquid. The small amount of liquid that was released outside of the fiber box remained on the pallet under the box. The leaking box and spill pads used to clean up the spill were overpacked together for continued transportation to the final disposal facility.",Veolia's safety manager will remind the team that when shipping a package containing inner containers of liquid material a sufficient amount of vermiculite or spill dry should be used to cushion the inner containers during transportation. The vermiculite or spill dry must be in a quantity that will be able to absorb the entire contents of the liquid material.

One bolt was missing a nut (found on the pressure plate), one nut was loose.  Crew attempted to tighten without stopping the leak.  The crew re-entered and loosened the flange, the leak did not worsen so the flange was removed.  Product was on top of the ball valve and was swirling.  The gasket had a depressed area and was changed out.  The flange was tightened, and the leak continued.  The liquid valve was cycled several times and the flange removed.  The product was no longer moving.  The gasket was flipped over, flange tightened, and the leak stopped.  Upon arrival of the shipper, the flange was removed, the product was removed off the ball valve, filled with water, and ensured the ball valve was secured with no releases.

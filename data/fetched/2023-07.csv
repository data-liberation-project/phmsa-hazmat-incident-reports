The fire was caused by undeclared and improperly packaged Lithium Ion Batteries (EV Vehicle Batteries). The container was loaded at a facility in St Louis, Missouri, chosen by the shipper. However, the shipping documents provided by the shipper to Apex Logistics, declared the commodity as ""Copper Flakes"" and not dangerous goods. RESPONSE: Upon notification of the fire, Apex Logistics International LLC informed the steamship line CMA CGM that there could be undeclared dangerous goods in all the containers from this shipper. 24 containers from this shipper were in Norfolk, VA.  INVESTIGATION: A surveyor has inspected the containers, and out of the 24 containers, all 24 of them have been identified to contain some form of dangerous goods, specifically batteries either class 9 or class 8. Some of the containers, contained D/D/R Lithium Batteries that were correctly packed according to the 49 CFR, however at least 4 containers contained unpacked Recycled Lithium Batteries (EV Batteries).  CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: Due to the severity and complexity of the incident, the shipper, Zhiyun Sports LLC, has authorized Apex Logistics International LLC to arrange the pickup, storage, and return of the containers. Apex Logistics has contracted a hazardous materials emergency service (Hepaco) to assist in the offloading and safe storage of these dangerous goods.","Apex Logistics International is not the shipper, however the shipper has been made aware of the correct reference to packaging and preparation in accordance with the 49 CFR. In addition this shipper has been blacklisted from shipping with Apex Logistics International.  Apex will continue to develop its Know Your Customer (KYC) training, in order to better vet potential violators of the 49 CFR.  In addition, we will attempt to identify shippers and consignees related to the recycling business to reduce the likelihood of undeclared Battery Shipments.

During the process, the employee punctured a 55-gallon steel drum with the drum cart while placing it in an outbound trailer. The employee was moving the drums into the trailer and misjudged the distance to the drum piercing it with the forks of the drum cart and caused a leak from the drum. About a gallon of liquid leaked out of the impacted drum. The drum was overpacked into an 85 gallon salvage drum, the spill cleaned up, and transportation to the ultimate disposal facility was continued without further incident. The duration of release is anticipated to be less than 1 minute as the employee noticed the accident right away.",On 7/17/2023 the Veolia safety manager was notified of the spill. The results of the investigation revealed that the employee simply misjudged the distance from the corner of the pallet to the nearby drum that was hit. The hole was on the bottom of the drum. The employee removed himself from duty and left Veolia for the day.

I had checked on the package earlier to see where it needed to go, and did not see any leaking around the package. Someone had grabbed the cart that the package was on, and put it on the rollers attached to the chute, and about 30 minutes later, I heard the manager call out that there was a leaking Hazmat. I ran over to the area, and the manager, a PH, and another QA were picking up the leaking, corrosive Hazmat with their bare hands, putting it into a tote, and making the package leak everywhere. I immediately told them to set the package down and to clear the area. I let them know that it was a corrosive liquid and that it could burn them. They had already set it on the tugger, and it was leaking all over the back of the tugger as well. They set it down, and I grabbed it, and put it on my QA cart. When I set it on the cart, the liquid splashed up on my arms and on my left leg (as I was wearing shorts), and it started burning my skin. I told them to immediately clear the area, go rinse their hands, and I took my cart to the QA area, and hurried to the Hazmat shower to start rinsing my arms and leg off. After I had rinsed off for about 8 to 10 mins, I then went back and got the tugger that had been leaked on, and took it to the QA area to put it out of order. I then took my QA cart to the Hazmat cage and put the damaged portion of the package into a lined salvage drum. DescribePack: Package failed due to a loose cap on one of the bottles of Warewashing Detergents. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: I went to the spill area, and put the chemical neutralizer onto the spilled liquid and then put the shredded absorbing material onto it as well. I put caution tape over the area, and the next morning, I pH tested several spots, as well as the spots on the tugger, and then put down more neutralizer as needed. I then waited until about 11:00a that morning to sweep up the neutralizer and absorbing material into a hazardous material bag, and place it into the salvage drum with the other damaged portion of the damaged package.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box,4G,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Fedex Ground Package System, Inc.",US,

A mist from the top of the tanker trailer had landed on a car following our TT; Due to the HM product, EMS was activated. Fire, Police and HM responded. There was an light odor of the product in the air. A check of a valve at the top of the tanker revealed that hit was not fully closed. The driver had performed a pre trip inspection and the valve was closed at that time. No product was exiting the tank at this time. The product, which is not under pressure, would only be able to exit that valve while ascending or descending inclines. On flat ground the product· would not be able to be released. The valve was secured by HM Responders. The tanker was allowed to complete the remainder of the trip ( Approx 1/2 mile) to be unloaded. Two passerbys claimed to be affected by the product. They were transported to a local hospital for observations, then released. C Three Logistics has contracted with a HM response cleanup operation to properly decontaminate the exterior of the affected motor vehicle.","C Three Logistics will be communicating with and working with the shipper, in order to ensure that their loading operators and our drivers are aware of the importance of properly securing the valve and to ensure that the safety measures are properly adhered to.

At the intersection of Hwy 42 and Texaco Rd, a 2012 Nissan traveling east on Texaco Rd failed to stop at a stop sign and collided with Plains transport, causing the tank trailer to separate from the tractor and roll over into the ditch. Upon separation, the landing gear broke off and punctured a 3x3 inch hole in the trailer, at the 7 o'clock position if upright, but upon roll over, puncture was located at the 10 o'clock position.  As a result of the collision, 70 gallons of diesel from the transport fuel tank and approximately 2 gallons of hydraulic fluid, from the trailer hydraulic pump and lines, were released to the roadway and roadside ditch. The Plains vehicle and the other vehicle were non drivable and had to be towed from the scene. An absorbent was applied to the roadway to encapsulate the diesel and hydraulic fluid, then swept and contained in 55 gallon drums. The impacted roadside ditch has been excavated to remove impacted soil and manifested for disposal, in accordance with TCEQ clean-up criteria. . .  The Plains employee was injured and treated at a medical facility.

Initially, the employee did not see any damaged or wet boxes, so he proceeded to break down the pallet to inspect each box. After breaking down the pallet, a wet Questar box (141G) was discovered. Veolia estimates approximately one quart of liquid was released during the spill, most of which was absorbed by the fiber box. It appears that a bottle of allyl bromide broke in transit leading to the saturation of the box and release of liquid. The small amount of liquid that was released outside of the fiber box remained on the pallet under the box. The leaking box and spill pads used to clean up the spill were overpacked together for continued transportation to the final disposal facility.",Veolia's safety manager will remind the team that when shipping a package containing inner containers of liquid material a sufficient amount of vermiculite or spill dry should be used to cushion the inner containers during transportation. The vermiculite or spill dry must be in a quantity that will be able to absorb the entire contents of the liquid material. The proper amount of cushioning should be used to ensure glass bottles do not break as a truck or trailer travels down the road.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The issue identified and containment measures were communicated to Sabic’s representative- Greg Horton (Greg.Horton2@Sabic.com, 812-305-2295).

Upon the contractor’s arrival, personnel observed that the released material impacted a 5ft-by-5ft area of the trailer floor and a 2ft-by-2ft area of asphalt yard.  Lone Star Hazmat Response personnel estimated that  five (5) gallons of material was released due to  loose caps on almost  all the 1-gallon plastic jugs on the pallet. Lone Star Hazmat Response personnel removed all the plastic jugs from the cardboard packaging and verified that all the  jugs were impacted from the pallet.  Lone Star Hazmat Response deployed Sodium Bicarbonate to neutralize the impacted areas and then placed down Oil Dri as an absorbent. The spent material was gathered and placed into two 55-gallon poly drums along with the impacted cardboard. The impacted 1-gallon plastic jugs were containerized into two 95-gallon poly drums and two (2) 55-gallon poly drums.

HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found a slow leak from the bottom outlet flange at the bottom of the chute.

The Fairmont City, IL fire department responded and extinguished the fire- no injuries were reported and no waterways impacted. Upon opening of the container, it was determined the lading included a hazardous commodity that was not described on the shipper's bill-of-lading; (UN3480, Lithium-Ion Batteries, Class 9, PG II). There were no indications of a hazardous material shipment on shipper's bill-of-lading or the freight container.   CSXT emergency response contractor, ENVIROSERVE, was dispatched to the scene for cleanup after scene was released by the fire dept.  The response contractor decontaminated all impacted areas and separated damaged lading into one roll-off unit.  All damaged freight was transported to the customer’s facility for further handling.   In addition to the shipment containing an undeclared hazardous materials, the cause of the fire/explsoin was due to inadequate blocking and bracing of the lading inside the container.  This allowed the lading to rub against itself, creating arc-friction, resulting in an explosion with fire.  The rail shipper, CMA-CGM America LLC, representative was notified by CSXI Customer Service, Case 672321.

The hazmat package was slightly leaking so it was placed in a hazardous materials tote and taken to the hazmat processing area for further inspection. Spill was very miniscule as the fiberboard absorbed majority of the liquid. DescribePack: The outside of the package is labeled ""CONTAINS 12 - 1 LITERS"" but inside the package were only 4 - 1 Liter plastic bottles with no other packaging material to prevent movement. The amount of empty space and room for bottles to move about during transit caused a lid on one of the 1-Liter bottles to open, resulting in 1/2 liter spill from the inside of the box. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: The manager who lifted the trailer door and unloaded the package immediately let QA personnel know and put the strong smelling package in a tote away from the area.

QA took the time to look around the area for any residue to clean it up off the surface(s). Using a cart the damaged package was wheeled over to the QA station in unload.

The leak was identified by ODOT Hazmat Inspector C Kuenzi.  The car was isolated for safe inspection by a BNSF contractor.  Inspection confirmed that vapor was releasing through the VRV.  Responders attempted to vent the car and remove the VRV to put a plug in its place to secure the release.  The threaded VRV was unable to be removed by responders.  In consultation with the shipper, it was determined to clean and purge the car and ship to shop for repair under an OTMA.  An inspection can be performed at that time to determine the cause of release through the VRV.  There was no cleanup as all vapor dissipated.

James Courtney, a CSXT hazardous materials manager, was dispatched to the scene and found (2) of (6) manway cover bolts less than tool tight.  The manway bolts were tightened to secure the car for movement inside the yard.  The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to Kraton Chemicals representative: Gerri Sage (904-316-3655, Gerri.Sage@Kraton.com). Prior to releasing the car into transportation, HEPACO, a CSX response contractor, cleaned the impacted surfaces on the top and sides of the car, inspected the manway gasket, re-secured all manway cover bolts tool tight, and applied manway custody seal #000102.

The fire was caused by undeclared and improperly packaged Lithium Ion Batteries (EV Vehicle Batteries). The container was loaded at a facility in St Louis, Missouri, chosen by the shipper. However, the shipping documents provided by the shipper to Apex Logistics, declared the commodity as ""Copper Flakes"" and not dangerous goods. RESPONSE: Upon notification of the fire, Apex Logistics International LLC informed the steamship line CMA CGM that there could be undeclared dangerous goods in all the containers from this shipper. 24 containers from this shipper were in Norfolk, VA.  INVESTIGATION: A surveyor has inspected the containers, and out of the 24 containers, all 24 of them have been identified to contain some form of dangerous goods, specifically batteries either class 9 or class 8. Some of the containers, contained D/D/R Lithium Batteries that were correctly packed according to the 49 CFR, however at least 4 containers contained unpacked Recycled Lithium Batteries (EV Batteries).  CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: Due to the severity and complexity of the incident, the shipper, Zhiyun Sports LLC, has authorized Apex Logistics International LLC to arrange the pickup, storage, and return of the containers. Apex Logistics has contracted a hazardous materials emergency service (Hepaco) to assist in the offloading and safe storage of these dangerous goods.","Apex Logistics International is not the shipper, however the shipper has been made aware of the correct reference to packaging and preparation in accordance with the 49 CFR. In addition this shipper has been blacklisted from shipping with Apex Logistics International.  Apex will continue to develop its Know Your Customer (KYC) training, in order to better vet potential violators of the 49 CFR.  In addition, we will attempt to identify shippers and consignees related to the recycling business to reduce the likelihood of undeclared Battery Shipments.

The leak occurred when the employee was moving the drums into the outbound trailer and the employee noticed that the drums were very old and liquid was coming out of two of them. The drums were only supposed to contain solid material.  It is assumed that a small amount of liquid got into the drums prior to pick up and they leaked when being transported from the pick up at the customer's site in Clay NY to the Veolia's office in Kenmore, NY. Less than a liter of liquid leaked out of both of the drums. Liquid was only observed on trailer right below drum and did not leak out of the vehicle.   The drums were overpacked into 85 gallon salvage drums, the spill was cleaned up, and the drums were transported to the ultimate disposal facility without further incident. The duration of release is anticipated to be less than 1 minute as the employee noticed the leak right away.",On 7/18/2023 the Veolia safety manager was notified of the spill. The results of the investigation indicated that there were multiple drums that were supposed to ship from the customer's site and many were rusty due to age.

I had checked on the package earlier to see where it needed to go, and did not see any leaking around the package. Someone had grabbed the cart that the package was on, and put it on the rollers attached to the chute, and about 30 minutes later, I heard the manager call out that there was a leaking Hazmat. I ran over to the area, and the manager, a PH, and another QA were picking up the leaking, corrosive Hazmat with their bare hands, putting it into a tote, and making the package leak everywhere. I immediately told them to set the package down and to clear the area. I let them know that it was a corrosive liquid and that it could burn them. They had already set it on the tugger, and it was leaking all over the back of the tugger as well. They set it down, and I grabbed it, and put it on my QA cart. When I set it on the cart, the liquid splashed up on my arms and on my left leg (as I was wearing shorts), and it started burning my skin. I told them to immediately clear the area, go rinse their hands, and I took my cart to the QA area, and hurried to the Hazmat shower to start rinsing my arms and leg off. After I had rinsed off for about 8 to 10 mins, I then went back and got the tugger that had been leaked on, and took it to the QA area to put it out of order. I then took my QA cart to the Hazmat cage and put the damaged portion of the package into a lined salvage drum. DescribePack: Package failed due to a loose cap on one of the bottles of Warewashing Detergents. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: I went to the spill area, and put the chemical neutralizer onto the spilled liquid and then put the shredded absorbing material onto it as well. I put caution tape over the area, and the next morning, I pH tested several spots, as well as the spots on the tugger, and then put down more neutralizer as needed. I then waited until about 11:00a that morning to sweep up the neutralizer and absorbing material into a hazardous material bag, and place it into the salvage drum with the other damaged portion of the damaged package.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box,4G,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Fedex Ground Package System, Inc.",US,

The driver quickly walked inside the building where the customer tank is located to check the status of the tank and then walked back out of the building to monitor the offload process. Upon exiting the building the driver noticed that the customer's connection point had failed (PVC cam-lock fitting broke free from tank piping) and approximately 5-gallons of product had been spilled to the ground. The driver quickly shut down the offloading operation and notified customer site personnel who immediately contained and cleaned up the spill. No injuries or property damage occurred as a result of this spill.","The City of Concordia Water Treatment Plant (Concordia, MO) was contacted by Occidental Technical Service personnel  to review an incident involving a Basic Chemical's trailer of Sodium Chlorite solution being delivered. The customer site superintendent reported that the fitting was original and had never been changed. Photos showed worn threads with excessive salt build up. Concordia is performing inspections of the piping and fittings and will replace any deficient couplings and fittings on the system. They are implementing a preventive maintenance program to visually inspect these fittings each time they are used and will be replacing them annually going forward.

As part of the recovery and remediation, the storage tank offloaded into two tanker trailers (MC331 ). On 7-27-23, the pressure relief valve on one of the recovery tanker trailers released a mixture of Ammonia and Propane in to the atmosphere. The release was caused by an increase in pressure caused by an Exothermic Reaction between the two commodities. The valve reset, but an unknown quantity of product was lost. As a result, representatives from PHMSA, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Indiana State Police and independent response personnel developed a new and more timely recovery procedure (Liquid Flare). The remaining products were safely rendered safe and the incident was declared complete.  A copy of the report from the recovery/remediation company is attached.

There was an light odor of the product in the air. A check of a valve at the top of the tanker revealed that hit was not fully closed. The driver had performed a pre trip inspection and the valve was closed at that time. No product was exiting the tank at this time. The product, which is not under pressure, would only be able to exit that valve while ascending or descending inclines. On flat ground the product· would not be able to be released. The valve was secured by HM Responders. The tanker was allowed to complete the remainder of the trip ( Approx 1/2 mile) to be unloaded. Two passerbys claimed to be affected by the product. They were transported to a local hospital for observations, then released. C Three Logistics has contracted with a HM response cleanup operation to properly decontaminate the exterior of the affected motor vehicle.","C Three Logistics will be communicating with and working with the shipper, in order to ensure that their loading operators and our drivers are aware of the importance of properly securing the valve and to ensure that the safety measures are properly adhered to.

At the intersection of Hwy 42 and Texaco Rd, a 2012 Nissan traveling east on Texaco Rd failed to stop at a stop sign and collided with Plains transport, causing the tank trailer to separate from the tractor and roll over into the ditch. Upon separation, the landing gear broke off and punctured a 3x3 inch hole in the trailer, at the 7 o'clock position if upright, but upon roll over, puncture was located at the 10 o'clock position.  As a result of the collision, 70 gallons of diesel from the transport fuel tank and approximately 2 gallons of hydraulic fluid, from the trailer hydraulic pump and lines, were released to the roadway and roadside ditch. The Plains vehicle and the other vehicle were non drivable and had to be towed from the scene. An absorbent was applied to the roadway to encapsulate the diesel and hydraulic fluid, then swept and contained in 55 gallon drums. The impacted roadside ditch has been excavated to remove impacted soil and manifested for disposal, in accordance with TCEQ clean-up criteria. . .  The Plains employee was injured and treated at a medical facility. Occupant of other vehicle perished at the scene.","No recommendations or actions were taken, as not deemed necessary due to Plains following DOT guidelines and not at fault for this incident.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,250875,PLAINS MARKETING LP,US,

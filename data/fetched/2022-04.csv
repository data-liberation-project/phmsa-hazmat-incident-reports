He immediately notified us via radio and we moved to contain the spill, which had already spread to 12 nearby packages. The acid had reacted to contact with the metal and created hydrogen gas reaction (which was stopped by application of pH neutralizer), and leaked through the truck floor. ERTS was notified and a report submitted via phone. A cleanup crew was sent out to clean the truck and the spill area below it. ERTS advised that we add inert material on top of the pH neutralizer and the truck remain in place, inactive until ther cleanup crew came, as ignition could ignite the gas reacting within.

At 2145 ET, Hepaco arrived onsite and advised the release outside the trailer was approximately one cup spread over a 1"" by 50' area of the asphalt. No soil drains, or waterways were impacted. Hepaco entered the trailer and located the leaking tote and discovered the valve was not completely closed. Hepaco tightened the valve and secured the cap. There was minimal impact on the trailer floor, less than 1-cup. Hepaco wiped the area with absorbing pads. Added water and tested the pH, it was neutral.

When they reached the designated stop point the driver shut down the product flow by closing the valves on the trailer.  He then hooked up his air compressor line to the bleeder valve, turned on the compressor, and opened up the bleeder valve which should have injected air pressure in to the product hoses to help clear them to make it safe to disconnect.  However when he opened the bleeder valve nothing was happening.  He soon realized that he had a knot in his airline.  After he got it untangled air start blowing through the line.  He was standing near where the airline was connected to the bleeder valve and product started spraying out from that connection as the rubber grommet inside the bleeder valve was evidently worn out.  It sprayed up under his face shield and impacted his lower face (not his eyes).  He immediately ran over to the safety shower and rinses for 30 seconds.  Then he came back, shut down his compressor, waited for the product to stop spraying out from the leaky connection, then closed the bleeder valve and went back to the safety shower for 15 minutes.  We connected him with the nurse Triage team and they advised he didn't need to seek treatment unless he felt any symptoms which he did not.",The grommet showed signs of aging and deterioration.  I coached the driver on checking it good before hooking up to it but admittedly its not in a great spot to easily check it.  I did however also coach the driver to ensure he is at a good angle when opening and closing valves so that his PPE takes the impact from any potential product releases.  I followed up with him the next day and confirmed he is still feeling fine.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"SCHNEIDER NATIONAL BULK CARRIERS, INC.",US,

The trailer was placed back in the dock and it was discovered that a tote was leaking at the site of the valve.  It was discovered that the valve was stuck open but the cap was still intact.  Since the cap was still on there was little liquid that leaked out.  The tote was removed from the trailer and repackaged.,Further investigation reveaied there was a leak from another tote that was located at our disposal facility.  The tote was of the same design.  It appears that the totes were received from the same requalifier and had similar issues with the piping on the bottom of the IBC not connecting properly to the valve.  All totes of this design from the requalifer have been pulled from Veolia operations.

This pallet was loaded onto the aircraft at a previous station KATL. He decided to offload the pallet at our station according to our company’s emergency procedure 8.1.1. The pallet was then being put in the backyard of Swissport warehouse. On the same day at 16:10 local time Seattle, the Swissport called the fire department to come out and only assessed whether they needed to respond, which they did not, and told Swissport to call back again if it began leaking more or actively overflowing. The cleaning company Clean Harbors arrived at Swissport at 16:35 for the clean up. They identified the leaking drums and proceeded to put the one damaged drum into another yellow drum for storage; the rest of the shipment is safely stored in the secured area inside the Swissport warehouse along with the damaged drum right now. Clean Harbors stated that “When we arrived on site all the drum were still bungee and wrapped, we removed the bungees and plastic wrap to identify the leaking drum. One drum had damage to the bottom of it that looked like damage from a drum loader or forklift forks. Approximately 5 to 10 gallons look to have leaked out of the drum”.We called the PERS 24 Hour emergency number at 801-629-0667 to report the incident and the reference number is #202204290610213.

Employees walked by the parked truck and noticed a solvent smell and a drip from the side of the truck. They inspected the truck and identified a leaking 5 gallon pail. Employees opened the back door of the truck and inspected all containers within the truck. Upon inspection it was determined that there was a 5 gallon drum that was used for liquids when it was only rated for solids. It was a ""screw type"" lid closure and it did not prevent the liquid contents from spilling out of it. The drum was overpacked into a suitable container for continued transportation.   The liquid was cleaned up with spill pads and absorbent and the pail/drum was overpacked along with the clean up materials. The duration of release is anticipated to be about an hour from leaving the shipper site to the Veolia office.","On 4/29/2021 the Veolia safety manager of Marlborough, MA was notified. The results of the investigation is that a drum containing liquid was incorrectly selected by customer and not caught by Veolia employee prior to shipment. This was due to human error when loading the container with the solvent.

He said he heard a pop and the vacuum pressure dropped to around 10 Inches of vacuum. He assumed the trailer was full and ended the loading process. After leaving the customefs facility, the driver made a tum and saw in his mirror that product had sloshed from the dome lid and was running down the side of the tank. Indiana State Police responded immediately and recommended a local towing service that the officer thought had the assets to clean up the spill on the roadway. It was later discovered that a small amount had run down the side of the roadway and gotten into a storm sewer. Veolia notified a remediation company that responded and sucked the product out of the storm drain, removed a small amount of impacted soil, and cleaned the surface of the roadway. It was determined that the gasket on the rear dome lid had failed and fallen into the tank, causing the tank to lose vacuum.

The car was isolated and the KCS Environmental& Hazmat Department mobilized a railroad qualified response contractor to investigate and mitigate the leak. The Louisiana State Police was notified (report number 22-01796).  Upon arrival, the response contractor observed that the release originated from under the sealed protective housing cover. Once the protective housing cover was opened, the responders observed that the secondary closure plugs were not installed on the liquid and vapor valves. The liquid and vapor valves were found in the closed position. The source of the release was the pipe fitting connection between the liquid valve and pipe threads. The liquid valve was rotated in clockwise direction to tighten the connection and stop the leak. The resident pressure was vented from the tank car. The spilled material was recovered for disposal and the tank car exterior and ballast section decontaminated and neutralized.   File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated based on the best information available at the time of filing. This shipment was offered as a 'bulk' shipment, aka one car load, therefore the exact amount offered in this package is not known to the carrier. This carrier does not have access to mass balance data which can exactly quantify this value.","The Kansas City Southern Railway(KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It Is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.(Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

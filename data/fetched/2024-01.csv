The FO and CA were waiting for refueling to be completed before doing the before start checked to the line. The F3, came in the cockpit and said there was a “medical issue” he then corrected and said ”safety issue in the jetway”. The CA was walking into the galley was told it was a bag fire in the jetway.  When he stepped into the jetway, he observed a wet bag, 2 empty water bottles, and fire extinguisher, next to an open bag.  It had a  blue battery disconnected from the bag. The F1 was watching over it with fire gloves. The CA then asked all in the jetway (starting to get crowded) if fire rescue was notified and was told ops knows about it. He immediately went into the cockpit and called ground operations to let them know they were had a bag fire in the jetway that appeared to be out. He also mentioned that he believed ops had informed Port authority but would confirm. He called OPS on the radio and they knew. He asked them to call the Port Authority to have the bag looked at. They said they would.  On his way back to the jetway he noticed all the customers were in their seats he checked on the bag. No fire and then made a PA to let the customers know all was safe and what had happened.  After things settled down it became clear to me what an amazing job the Flight attendants did. The F1 said she observed the customer walking down the jetway rolling a smoking bag. She stoped the customer prevented the bag from getting on the aircraft and called for safety team on the PA. She and the team went into action and by the time I got to the jetway, they had the fire out the battery cooled with water and the customers in their seats. Obviously the aircraft passageway was initially clogged with bags customers etc. that was cleared and the F3 got to the cockpit to let us know about the issue. I can’t say enough about how well the flight attendants did.   The suitcase was found to contain a medical refrigerator, manufactured by North Sciences.  The battery connected to the refrigerator was a 120 wH, Lithium Ion Battery.  It's only markings were as follows: Stirling Engine Li-ion Battery Model: JCB2405A Rated: 24V-5000mAh-120Wh Date: 2021-7 All other markings were in foreign language.  The bag also contained a Power Supply Unit, manufacturer unknown.  It had a Lithium Ion battery rated at 257.52 Wh.  It did not go into thermal runaway and did not contribute to the event.  Both items were confiscated and placed on internal reports DGR53-24 (battery) and DGR64-24 (Power Supply).",The Inflight Crewmembers following the instructions in their manual and were able to resloved the situation quickly.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Cargill, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report #2024-0116-0040). HEPACO, a CSX Emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and confirmed the initial report of a leaking BOV. Upon further inspection, it was determined product was leaking past the internal ball of the BOV due to a defective component.  It was also noted that due to a deteriorated gasket, the BOV’s secondary closure cap was unable to contain the leak.  The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper-s representative- Daniel Gernant (303-709-1653, Daniel_Gernant@cargill.com).  Contractor personnel installed a new gasket on the secondary closure cap to contain stop the release.

He then pulled off at the Sulfur Ky exit and inspected his load he noticed a frozen material at the back door of the trailer. The driver then grabbed some   absorbent to put down at the back of the trailer to prevent material from getting on the ground. The driver then called our emergency line at 1351ET to report the incident. The team was dispatched and arrived at 1745ET to start the clean up. The team dawned the proper PPE and proceeded to clean up the frozen material at the back of the trailer. There was aprxemetly 1-2oz that made it to the ground everything else was contained to  the trailer and absorbent wags. Once that was cleaned they opened the trailer and found material frozen on the floor and proceeded to clean it up. They then gained access to the drum that was about half way in the trailer and found that the bottom of the drum has approximately 1in crack at the bottom. The team put the damaged container into a salvage drum along with absorbents used to clean up the material. The team was able to finish the clean up around 0100ET.,We believe that a nail from the pallet may have been the cause of the damage to the drum.

When I arrived to look at the car, I noticed that the car was leaking from the breadbox cover.  I removed seal #0000823 and opened the lid to find that the leak was coming from the Apollo Liquid Valve.  I saw that the valve stem nut was backed off the stem and that the valve handle was not secured tight to the stem anymore.  It looked like when someone tried to tighten the valve, that is did not close all the way because the valve handle did not fit properly since it was loose.  I applied the handle back on the stem and tried closing the valve.  The valve did then close and the leak stopped.  The liquid was leaking from out of the valve plug which was not tight.  I tried to tighten the valve stem nut but I could not get it to tighten.  I backed off the nut completely and found that someone tried installing a course thread nut onto a fine thread valve stem.  That is why the nut would not tighten down onto the handle.  I then tried installing a fine thread nut and I was able to get it to tighten down.  I felt that is was a good fix.  I then removed the plug from the valve since it was leaking and found that there was no thread tape on the threads that were screwed into the valve.  There was a build up of old tape on the top portion of the threads but not on the threads that would actually seal.  Installed new thread sealant and tightened the valve plug.  I then closed the breadbox lid and inatalled new seal #0000229.  I then released the car for transportation.",Better car securement procedures need followed.,No,                             ,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Wheeling and Lake Erei Railway,US,

At some point driver claims that a 3rd party driver veered into his lane causing him to take minor evasive action. This lead to loss of control when he contacted an icy road surface. The tanktruck rolled into the median where it came to rest. Ther was a rupture of a vapor valve as well as the diesel fuel tank. Luckily due to the cold weather only minor amounts of ammonia were lost through the vapor break. The police and local fire department were called to the scene to set up roadblocks and control the area.  The Huntsville, AL Hazmat team eventually made it to the site to assess the situation. It was deemed feasible to set the truck upright and tow away to a remote location for product offload and depressurization. Fugitive vapors were controlled by water application by the FD. A fuel cleanup team has been assigned to remove soil and diesel fuel as well.","Rollover was due to unfortunate deterioration of conditions which is difficult to avoid. 3rd party may have played a role in the accident as well, but unfortunately there is lack of conclusive video evidence or an eyewitness to corroborate this. In future we will further promote the fact that our drivers have the last say when making a delivery as to whether it is safe or not without any repercussion.

Immediately after the accident occurred, the roads to the site were closed due to the weather and the unit was left onsite. No drains or waterways were reported to be impacted by the release. On January 18, 2024, at 0256 EST, XPO Logistics contacted Emergency Response and Training Solutions (ERTS) to manage and oversee the above referenced incident. ERTS secured Haz-Mat Response Inc. (HMRI) to perform emergency response and remediation. On January 18, 2024, HMRI responded to the site at 1140 ET to obtain an assessment of the site. At the time, there was no visual release of material from the unit, but it was also in 5-6” of snow. Once HMRI left site, the wrecker unit showed up at approximately 1300 ET to haul the unit offsite. Initially they did not report seeing a release of material when the unit was up righted. On January 19th, HMRI mobilized to the wrecker yard to find the batteries had released approximately 50-100 gallons of battery acid to the trailer floor, walls, ceiling, and soil along the passenger side of the unit in the wrecker yard. An estimated 5-gallons of acid impacted a 26’ x 1’ area of the soil in the dirt lot. Soda ash and floor dry were deployed to the impacted trailer floor to neutralize the acid. The wrecker crew then advise to HMRI there was a loss of acid to the incident site in the soil median where the unit came to a rest. HMRI secured the unit at the wrecker’s yard and mobilized to the accident site where they confirmed an approximate 2-gallon release to a 5’ x 15’ area of the median ditch. The area was hand excavated and all impacted soil placed into a drum which was removed from site. At this point, the 7-gallons of material confirmed to impact soil/dirt was reported to the WY DEQ. On January 22, 2024, at 1100 ET, HMRI returned to the wrecker yard to complete trailer remediation. Each battery was wiped down and inspected. All 70 salvageable batteries were secured on the unit on 4 pallets to be hauled back to XPO with the unit. The trailer floor was neutralized with soda ash and floor dry, and the soil was hand excavated. A total of 213 damaged batteries were containerized into (9) 95-gallon poly drums and will attempt to be recycled. All impacted debris including the impacted floor dry, soda ash, soil, dirt, poly sheeting, cardboard, and PPE were collected and containerized into (2) 55-gallon poly and (3) 95-gallon poly drums for disposal.

When he began to tilt one of the metal drums, he noticed that it was leaking from the bottom. He pushed the drum to its side to identify the leak and noticed multiple pin holes where material was leaking from. Due to the weight of the drum, the employee was unable to flip the drum by himself and sought assistance. With help, they were able to flipped the drum upside down to prevent further release of material from the drum. Approximately 30 gallons leaked out of the drum and into the unloading dock containment area. The damaged drum along with the 9 other drums from the same shipment were placed into a salvage drum.    The leaked liquid inside the trailer was absorbed and the liquid in the containment area was pumped out. The day before it was raining, so when the employee went inside of the trailer he did not see any visible signs of dripping or stains to show a possible leak. Nor did the employee see any abnormalities/ deficiencies to the drum before moving it. The actual duration of the spill is unknown however, Veolia believes that the spill occurred after the time of receiving into the facility since there was no evidence of any spill at our transfer location.","As a refresher, Veolia informed employees to always inspect their surroundings and to verify the condition of the drums prior to handling of containers. In addition, Veolia does not believe the cause of the spill was in transportation but rather due to foreign substance that corroded and created the pinholes.  This is based on the location of the pinholes which appear to be a random/spray pattern, in addition it appears that the bottom paint was stripped by the material in question that caused the corrosion. This was the only drum that was green in color on the bottom of the drum while the remaining common drums that were shipped, were not that color.  All drums were new and not reconditioned, made by the same drum manufacturer. The pinholes show evidence the corrosion started from exterior of the container since the pinholes shows multiple layers from the outside.   Due to the corrosion occurring at the bottom of the drum, likely the drum was exposed prior to being filled and likely stored upside down. It was stored near or around materials that may be incompatible with metal drums. In addition, the material that was inside the drum had a pH value of 7 and the chemical composition did not reveal anything that would be a concern for corrosion on metal. Veolia has reached out to the offeror in regards to our findings in order to mitigate from future occurrence.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The driver decided not to correct the transport, striking trees and caution chevrons, overturning the transport and splitting the trailer in half on impact. The trailer released the entire load 154 barrels.   Safety was immediately dispatched from Coffeyville Resources to start clean up and remediation. The Kansas Highway Patrol was dispatched at the time of the incident, the road was diverted while the transport and trailer was towed. Clean up began on 01/21 but was delayed due to weather conditions (rain and ice). The soil has been dug up and transported to a landfill. The Coffeyville Resources Pipeline group hauled Vac trucks of the water used to keep the soil from continuing to be contaminated to the Coffeyville Refinery.

The drive was about an hour back to the facility to unload for the end of the day. He arrive at approximately 1730 and when he opened the door to unload they noticed the drum was swelling up. The team at the facility emidiatly called for a team to come out and and address the container. The drum expanded to the point of failure at about 1830 before the team could arrive to address the situation. The bottom of the container failed and the contents was released into the truck with around 10 gallons making it to the pavement. They were able to contained it with absorbents and booms from spreading. The team arrived around 1930 to perform the clean up. They dawned the proper PPE and proceeded to clean up the material and overpacking the container to be shipped and disposed of properly. The crew was able to complete this around 2200.,We believe that the paint waste that was added by the customer just before the driver picked up drum may have had an incompatible material in it which caused the reaction.

The release was due to a forklift puncture to the bottom of the drum. The damaged drum was placed into an 85-gallon poly overpack. Absorbents were deployed to clean the impacted trailer floor and collected into (3) 55-gallon poly drums. A pressure washer and vac unit along with citric acid solution were then utilized to clean the impacted asphalt and catch basin. All impacted wastewater was placed into (7) 250-gallon poly totes.

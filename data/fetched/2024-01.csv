The drive was about an hour back to the facility to unload for the end of the day. He arrive at approximately 1730 and when he opened the door to unload they noticed the drum was swelling up. The team at the facility emidiatly called for a team to come out and and address the container. The drum expanded to the point of failure at about 1830 before the team could arrive to address the situation. The bottom of the container failed and the contents was released into the truck with around 10 gallons making it to the pavement. They were able to contained it with absorbents and booms from spreading. The team arrived around 1930 to perform the clean up. They dawned the proper PPE and proceeded to clean up the material and overpacking the container to be shipped and disposed of properly. The crew was able to complete this around 2200.,We believe that the paint waste that was added by the customer just before the driver picked up drum may have had an incompatible material in it which caused the reaction.

However, it was noticed that the the closure on the tote was loose. The closure was tightened and secured before loading onto the truck. Upon arrival at Veolia's 10-Day facility in Port Allen, LA, saturation was noticed on the trailer floor. Upon further inspection, the tote was identified as having a significant size crack in the top corner of the container that was not present at the time of pickup. It is believed that the container failed during transit. Approximately 5 gallons of material was spilled.",The container may have become brittle from extended exposure from the sun and other elements while in storage at the customer's site.

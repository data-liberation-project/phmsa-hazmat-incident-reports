The exact quantity of diesel was unknown at that time, but the caller stated that an estimated fifty yards of the surface had been impacted. The driver was no longer on the scene, but the local fire department was on site. No drains or waterways were reported to have been impacted. On May 03, 2023, ERS of OK was dispatched to the site with a vac truck.  Trooper Bussy, informed ERTS that there was a 15 ft-by-15 ft area of soil impacted with diesel that was about 10 in deep. Before the contractor arrived with the vac truck, the local fire department’s hazmat team was on site and would manage the tanker and truck being uprighted. At 0600 ERS arrived onsite to begin evaluating the release. At 0700 ET, ERS utilized their vac truck to evacuate the standing pool, which was at capacity with 2800 gallons onboard, a second vac truck was called for to remove all standing liquid. While waiting for the second vac truck the crew placed an absorbent boom down to secure the area for future excavation. At 1200 ET, the second vac truck arrived so the crew continued to collect the material.  At 1400 ET, ERS updated the site assessment of the impacted soil area being 300ft of a ditch and from 10ft to 1ft back and forth.  The main area that was impacted measured 200ft long and was estimated 15 -30ft wide.  At 1500 ET, ERS completed all ER clean-up on May 4, 2023. The scene was staged with a poly tarp, and multiple booms below the impacted soil. The area was flagged and is currently secure until further remediation is scheduled to recover the impacted soil.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,10000,ERTS,US,

Veolia employees set the drum down and placed spill pads around the bottom while we further investigated the material and condition of the container.  The investigation showed that the container had a significant leak when we tried to move it to its side or lift it for over packing. The container leak slowed down when we placed the drum flat on its bottom. We decided to try to overpack the container by placing it on its side and quickly sliding an 85 gallon over pack over the bottom of the drum. Ideally the overpack would catch most of the material that leaked out of the drum while we attempted the overpacking process. Unfortunately the drum totally failed as we placed it on its side allowing most of the material inside to flow into the trailer. Spill dry and spill pads were already placed in the area so the spill was contained at the time of release. The initial spill was a few gallons but once the bottom split/cracked an additional 35 gallons was released. The spilled material was cleaned up using floor dry/cat litter and the area was decontaminated. All spill clean up material was properly cleaned up by the Veolia team and we confirmed that no material released outside of the trailer.",Veolia's investigation showed that this particular container was refurbished and it was actually manufactured in 2018. It was also identified that the container was stored outside while it was at the drum refurbishing company. Veolia believes the age of the drum and the former storage conditions may have led to the splitting or cracking at the bottom of the drum. The Veolia team has been asked to inspect any container they accept from a drum refurbishing site. By inspecting the drums before providing them to customers or use them ourselves we may be able to identify an issue and remove the drum from service before an incident occurs.,No,,,,No,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

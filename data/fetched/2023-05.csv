The exact quantity of diesel was unknown at that time, but the caller stated that an estimated fifty yards of the surface had been impacted. The driver was no longer on the scene, but the local fire department was on site. No drains or waterways were reported to have been impacted. On May 03, 2023, ERS of OK was dispatched to the site with a vac truck.  Trooper Bussy, informed ERTS that there was a 15 ft-by-15 ft area of soil impacted with diesel that was about 10 in deep. Before the contractor arrived with the vac truck, the local fire department’s hazmat team was on site and would manage the tanker and truck being uprighted. At 0600 ERS arrived onsite to begin evaluating the release. At 0700 ET, ERS utilized their vac truck to evacuate the standing pool, which was at capacity with 2800 gallons onboard, a second vac truck was called for to remove all standing liquid. While waiting for the second vac truck the crew placed an absorbent boom down to secure the area for future excavation. At 1200 ET, the second vac truck arrived so the crew continued to collect the material.  At 1400 ET, ERS updated the site assessment of the impacted soil area being 300ft of a ditch and from 10ft to 1ft back and forth.  The main area that was impacted measured 200ft long and was estimated 15 -30ft wide.  At 1500 ET, ERS completed all ER clean-up on May 4, 2023. The scene was staged with a poly tarp, and multiple booms below the impacted soil.

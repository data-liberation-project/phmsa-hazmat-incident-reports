He took a tote to the lower yard to make room on the dock. He misjudged how close he was to another tote and that the forks stuck out beyond the width of the tote. This resulted in the tote behind being punctured with a 4X2"" hole.  The forklift operator got help from a coworker right away, they were able to flip the tote on its side on a spill pallet. Once the tote was on the spill pallet, dock employees notified their supervisor. The forklift operator placed booms and spill pads to keep the material contained. A drum vac was used to vacuum up standing liquid from the ground.  The supervisor immediately notified upper management about the spill. The supervisor was given a list of numbers to contact, one of those being Environmental Restitution to dispatch an emergency response (ER) team to respond to perform clean-up. Until the ER team arrived on-site, employees made sure everyone kept out of the area and that the spill was contained.  Once the ER team got to work, they transferred the waste into a new tote. This included material from the spill pallet, drum vac drum, and the remaining material in the punctured tote. The ER team decontaminated everything, pH tests were taken and about 10 yards of soil was dug up and placed into a roll-off bin. We are waiting for sample results in order to dispose of the soil.",We are considering the possibility of moving to a larger location so we have more room to work and to reduce handling of waste.

The released material was due to a load shift causing one (1) 5-gallon metal pail to be punctured. Once the telehandler arrived, they started unloading freight. They ceased work due to being unable to unload/reload a metal grate with product on it with the manpower and equipment they had. However, the driver called his safety manager who dispatched two drivers who had power pallet jackets to assist with moving the metal grate. If loaded in the original position, the freight risked puncturing another product. It was determined the metal grate should be taken on another truck instead of being reloaded in the same position. First Call Environmental-LTL deployed absorbents and containerized them into two (2) 55-gallon metal drums. All undamaged freight was loaded onto a new truck while the metal grate was loaded onto the original truck. Due to First Call Environmental-LTL not being able to hold hazardous waste, they took the generated waste the ESTES terminal in West Middlesex, Pennsylvania.

As of 02/15/2025, GCXA's Loadmasters; who accompany the aircraft as part of the crew, have detected several instances where Lithium Batteries were found as being undeclared in shipments prior to loading the aircraft. Since 02/15/2025, instructions from the Cargo Operations department of GCXA has been for the Loadmasters to remain vigilant and scrutinize all shipments that may be viewed as suspicious, i.e {labeling, marking on boxes, key words such as ""generators"" ""batteries"" etc) prior to loading any ULD's onboard the aircraft. On 03/13/2025, the Loadmasters working the flight scheduled for MIA-CFG-MIA, indicated at 07:08L that again {6th time since 02/15/25), Undeclared hazardous materials were found in the shipment prior to loading and consequently rejected the entire load. The instructions to the ground handler {NAS) was for them to break all the packages since the Loadmasters did not trust any items that were wrapped with black plastic shrink wrap. The Loadmasters reached out for guidance to the Cargo Operations leadership and was advised to stand firm on that decision to reject this shipment. The Loadasters instructed the ground handlers to begin inspecting the completed ULDs and eventually various items ranging from portable electric generators, undeclared car batteries to electric scooters were detected. IBC Airways were informed and eventually they cancelled the flight.  The FAA CMT was informed of the events.","Since this has been an ongoing situation, GCXA's Cargo Operations department has been attempting to support IBC Airways in mitigating these events. Several attempts were made since 02/15/2025 to notify, educate and discuss to the IBC Airways leadership and staff the importance of compliance and mitigating the issues that were identified and rejected.  The root causes identified were gaps in the acceptance process and IBC Airways as the freight fowarder/consolidator were not advising their clients of the requirements or putting the necessary actions in place.  02/15/2025- GXA3909 MIA-CMW: Undeclared Lithium ION batteries- Location IBC Airways warehouse/ramp 02/19/2025- GXA3909 MIA-HAV: Undeclared Lithium ION batteries- Location NAS warehouse/ramp 03/01/2025- GXA3909 MIA-CMW: Undeclared Lithium ION batteries/mislabel- Location IBC Airways warehouse/ramp 03/07/2025- GXA3913 MIA-HAV: Undeclared Lithium ION batteries- Location IBC Airways warehouse/ramp 03/10/2025- GXA2966 MIA-HAV: Undeclared Lithium ION batteries- Location IBC Airways warehouse/ramp 03/13/2025- GXA3933 MIA-CFG: Undeclared Lithium ION batteries- Location NAS warehouse/ramp 03/13/2025- GXA3911 MIA-SNU : Undeclared Lithium ION batteries- Location NAS warehouse/ramp  All Undeclared Hazardous materials were rejected by the Loadmasters and 4 flights liste¿ above had to be cancelled.",No,                             ,,,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Global Crossing Airlines, Inc",US,

Lower Kuskokwim School District (LKSD) engaged with Second Life Mac (SLM)(a company from Skokie,  IL) for them to buy their used computers, and provide all services to package and transport them.  Because of the very remote location of the computers (Bethel, AK), the LKSD followed SLM's  instructions to package and deliver to the airline. SLM instructed LKSD to not mark or label any of the packages, and to cover them under black shrink  wrap, deliver to the airline, and the airline agent would take care of everything. Neither the  Airline nor Airline Agent knew anything about this shipment. 5 pallets of these items were tendered  to the Airline in Bethel, AK, and described by the shipper on our AWB as ""ELECTRONICS"". Shipper was  asked if there were any hazardous materials in the shipment, and shipper answered NO. Shipper  signed the Airline's AWB and initialed that there was no hazardous materials in the shipment.  5  pallets were flown from Bethel to Anchorage, AK, consignee notified 3 times without picking the  freight up, and after 3 weeks, Airline contacted the Shipper and asked what to do with the  shipment? Shipper contacted the Consignee, and they then responded that day, and arrived the next day on  sight with marking and labeling to further move these pallets on FedEx. They applied the hazmat  dimond label to the 5 pallets while on our ramp.  It had rained, and some of the boxes got wet,  soaking some contents in water, which initiated a damage freight claim process.  No action was  taken on the claim, because of two issues: one-freight charges have not been paid for, two-shipment  was abandoned for three weeks with no communication from consignee. On March 5th, Airline was  notified of a demand letter from a lawyer for a claimed damage amount.  The demand letter was  elevated to airline administration, and was the first time administration became aware of the hidden hazmat  shipment. SLM has a third party involved, Jesse Carnahan with Lynx Enterprises (Wasilla, AK). The Airline does not know how much of or who is responsible for what between Lynx and SLM. Once administration became aware of the non-declared hazmat, an investigation ensued which led to this 5800.1 report. No release or damage to the lithium batteries has been declared.",Airline is reemphasizing additional questions to ask shippers with more examples of what hazmat is when asking if any hazmat is in their shipment.,No,                             ,,,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,55000,Everts Air Cargo,US,

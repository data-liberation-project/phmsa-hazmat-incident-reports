The caller stated that the released product was contained to the trailer floor at dock door #30. The terminal requested a contractor out for cleanup and containment. Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 0.5-gallons of product released to the packaging and inner box due to a forklift puncture. Absorbents were deployed and worked into the impacted area. The box containing 4 impacted pails, shrink wrap, and absorbents were containerized into a 55-gallon poly drum. The waste was staged onsite for terminal personnel to manage.

During their work, the crew noticed locomotive diesel fuel leaking out of the bottom of the TCBX 286060, listed as line 18 in track 3509. It was at this time that the crew notified the yardmaster who immediately notified BNSF mechanical and transportation officers on site. BNSF Mechanical promptly contacted the BNSF Hazmat team and began an active investigation into the leak and to apply containment.  The BOV was found with an ice plug in the broken BOV cap with damage to the closed BOV.  Fuel was recovered into a vacuum truck while a transload of remaining fuel occurred to another car.   An estimated 7,768 gallons was released from the car with approximately 6,350 gallons reaching soil.  Spilled fuel impacted tracks 3509 and 3510.  Investigation into extent of fuel impacts to soil and remediation began immediately.

Wayne, IN. The spill consisted of a 330-gallon plastic tote containing UN2735 AO-24, which was being unloaded off the trailer when XPO personnel noticed a trail of liquid leading up to the dock, and it then began gushing once it was set down. The terminal coned off the area. ERT dispatched a contractor for cleanup assistance. Contractors arrived onsite at 1255 ET. Crew confirmed approximately 3-gallons of product released to an 8' x 8' area of the dock floor and a 2' x 15' area of the trailer floor. Contractors stated the side of the tote was cracked due to a possible puncture occurring as a result of load shift. The material was transferred from the damaged tote into a new one. Absorbents were deployed and worked into the impacted areas. The damaged tote was then cut up and containerized along with all impacted absorbents into (3) 55-gallon poly drums.

The drum was loaded onto a trailer to proceed to its final destination and was received at the Veolia Richmond TSDF on 3/9.  The facility began the offloading process on 3/14/23.  When they opened the trailer, they noticed a cubic yard box laying on its side and a drum missing a lid. The contents of the drum was on the top of surrounding drums along with visible staining on the nearby walls of the trailer and cubic yard boxes. It appeared there was a chemical reaction which generated pressure inside the drum which eventually led to the top flying off and causing the cubic yard box which was loaded directly on top of the drum to flip. Veolia believes that during transportation from the Veolia Fremont transfer facility to the Richmond site, agitation occurred in which allowed for a chemical reaction causing the pressure to build up and likely the rupture of the drum was instant.   Veolia personnel offloaded the trailer and thoroughly wiped down the drums along with the trailer.  The drum along with all spill clean up debris was containerized into a salvage drum.","After talking with the shipper, Veolia believes the contents of the material was not the actual material shipped and it was improperly prepared for shipment. We believe that the material contained aluminum powder that was not reacted properly prior to shipment. The shipper failed to add enough water to properly react the aluminum powder and some aluminum powder was in clumps which did not react prior to shipment.  During the course of the shipment these clumps separated which allowed for water/moisture to react with the aluminum powder which caused the drum to pressurize and eventually rupture.   Veolia has spoken with the shipper and at this time all shipments are on hold until they have agreed to changes in their process. Veolia has notified the shipper of our findings and have requested that all their personnel will be properly trained. We are requesting certification of these training records. Additionally, Veolia has put safe guards in place so that Veolia personnel will need to verify that that the aluminum powder has properly reacted by agitating of the drum and leaving the material on site at the shipper's location for a week to make sure no further reaction will occur. Veolia is still finalizing the process with the shipper but we expect them to meet these conditions or otherwise Veolia will refuse to transport this material in the future.",Yes,,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The release was discovered on Monday, March 13, 2023.  Notifications were made to WL Black, Broker of Record for the generator, the waste generator and to SE/EO management. SE/EO responded immediately to the release that was contained within the building, deployed spill sorbents and dispatched a cleanup crew and safety representatives. A team of 1 response supervisor, 3 environmental response technicians, 2 site staff and a safety officer and HSE manager responded to the event. The broker/generator provided copies of profile for Nickle plating waste and SDSs for components believed added to one or more containers that had been shipped. Samples of the small amount of waste remaining in the failed tote were collected. These samples were noted to exhibit off-gassing and buildup of pressure within the closed sample container. The other containers appeared to be stable on inspection. Once spread of the release had been secured and contained, SE/EO collected as much of the spilled material as practicable using an empty vacuum truck and cleaned up the waste using granular sorbents, pads and booms. The work team utilized air monitoring equipment and work teams donned USEPA Level C Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to ensure the safety the work team members during cleanup. The waste, cleanup material and PPE were containerized by placing the waste in one (1) tote (original waste liquid/washwater/surfactant), five (5) drums (granular sorbents, rags and pads) and four (4) drums (sorbent booms and PPE).

They were able to get the box on the ground and the leaking stopped. The binder chains the secure the door were stuck inside the door, compromising the seal/gasket at the top of the door. After investigation, it was determined that the container had been delivered to the customer that way, and had been filled that way. It did not initially leak during loading because the material was mostly sludge. During transport, the solids settled, leaving more liquid on the top of the box. The material that leaked was cleaned up internally as it was at a TSDF with a response crew.

When the shipment arrived, a 55 gallon drum containing sodium hydroxide solid had a cover that was not secured properly. In addition there was liquid in the drum that spilled out the open lid onto the floor of the box van. The drum was sealed properly by fixing the lid so that it could continue transportation to the ultimate disposal facility.     The drum leaked about 1/2 gallon of class 8 material sodium hydroxide solution. The liquid was cleaned up with spill pads and absorbent and the lid on the drum was repositioned properly to prevent it from spilling. The duration of release is anticipated to be about 3 hours and an estimated 1/2 a gallon of sodium hydroxide solution leaked. The drum was still substantially full when the leak was discovered.

It was at this time that the crew notified the yardmaster who immediately notified BNSF mechanical and transportation officers on site. BNSF Mechanical promptly contacted the BNSF Hazmat team and began an active investigation into the leak and to apply containment.  The BOV was found with an ice plug in the broken BOV cap with damage to the closed BOV.  Fuel was recovered into a vacuum truck while a transload of remaining fuel occurred to another car.   An estimated 7,768 gallons was released from the car with approximately 6,350 gallons reaching soil.  Spilled fuel impacted tracks 3509 and 3510.

Wayne, IN. The spill consisted of a 330-gallon plastic tote containing UN2735 AO-24, which was being unloaded off the trailer when XPO personnel noticed a trail of liquid leading up to the dock, and it then began gushing once it was set down. The terminal coned off the area. ERT dispatched a contractor for cleanup assistance. Contractors arrived onsite at 1255 ET. Crew confirmed approximately 3-gallons of product released to an 8' x 8' area of the dock floor and a 2' x 15' area of the trailer floor. Contractors stated the side of the tote was cracked due to a possible puncture occurring as a result of load shift. The material was transferred from the damaged tote into a new one. Absorbents were deployed and worked into the impacted areas. The damaged tote was then cut up and containerized along with all impacted absorbents into (3) 55-gallon poly drums.

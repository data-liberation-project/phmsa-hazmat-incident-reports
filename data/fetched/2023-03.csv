It was at this time that the crew notified the yardmaster who immediately notified BNSF mechanical and transportation officers on site. BNSF Mechanical promptly contacted the BNSF Hazmat team and began an active investigation into the leak and to apply containment.  The BOV was found with an ice plug in the broken BOV cap with damage to the closed BOV.  Fuel was recovered into a vacuum truck while a transload of remaining fuel occurred to another car.   An estimated 7,768 gallons was released from the car with approximately 6,350 gallons reaching soil.  Spilled fuel impacted tracks 3509 and 3510.

It was where the external valve bolts to the discharge piping.  it was one drop per minute without pressure on it.  He got a bucket underneath.  I gave him the ok to proceed with the unload using light air pressure and and as long as it seemed to stay controlled and going in to his bucket.  He was able to get it unloaded but called me back at the end and advised that a second leak on the same discharge pipe developed during the unload.  8 drops hit the ground before he noticed that one.  It was the opposite end of the same section of pipe where there is another 8 bolt flange assembly, close to where the internal valve bolts to the barrel.  Trailer was placed out of service.",The shop updated that the flanged hardware was loose on both sides of the pipe.  They tightened it and vacuum tested it and it passed.

The drum was loaded onto a trailer to proceed to its final destination and was received at the Veolia Richmond TSDF on 3/9.  The facility began the offloading process on 3/14/23.  When they opened the trailer, they noticed a cubic yard box laying on its side and a drum missing a lid. The contents of the drum was on the top of surrounding drums along with visible staining on the nearby walls of the trailer and cubic yard boxes. It appeared there was a chemical reaction which generated pressure inside the drum which eventually led to the top flying off and causing the cubic yard box which was loaded directly on top of the drum to flip. Veolia believes that during transportation from the Veolia Fremont transfer facility to the Richmond site, agitation occurred in which allowed for a chemical reaction causing the pressure to build up and likely the rupture of the drum was instant.   Veolia personnel offloaded the trailer and thoroughly wiped down the drums along with the trailer.  The drum along with all spill clean up debris was containerized into a salvage drum.","After talking with the shipper, Veolia believes the contents of the material was not the actual material shipped and it was improperly prepared for shipment. We believe that the material contained aluminum powder that was not reacted properly prior to shipment. The shipper failed to add enough water to properly react the aluminum powder and some aluminum powder was in clumps which did not react prior to shipment.  During the course of the shipment these clumps separated which allowed for water/moisture to react with the aluminum powder which caused the drum to pressurize and eventually rupture.   Veolia has spoken with the shipper and at this time all shipments are on hold until they have agreed to changes in their process. Veolia has notified the shipper of our findings and have requested that all their personnel will be properly trained. We are requesting certification of these training records. Additionally, Veolia has put safe guards in place so that Veolia personnel will need to verify that that the aluminum powder has properly reacted by agitating of the drum and leaving the material on site at the shipper's location for a week to make sure no further reaction will occur. Veolia is still finalizing the process with the shipper but we expect them to meet these conditions or otherwise Veolia will refuse to transport this material in the future.",Yes,,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

SE/EO responded immediately to the release that was contained within the building, deployed spill sorbents and dispatched a cleanup crew and safety representatives. A team of 1 response supervisor, 3 environmental response technicians, 2 site staff and a safety officer and HSE manager responded to the event. The broker/generator provided copies of profile for Nickle plating waste and SDSs for components believed added to one or more containers that had been shipped. Samples of the small amount of waste remaining in the failed tote were collected. These samples were noted to exhibit off-gassing and buildup of pressure within the closed sample container. The other containers appeared to be stable on inspection. Once spread of the release had been secured and contained, SE/EO collected as much of the spilled material as practicable using an empty vacuum truck and cleaned up the waste using granular sorbents, pads and booms. The work team utilized air monitoring equipment and work teams donned USEPA Level C Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to ensure the safety the work team members during cleanup.

When the DGO arrived and approached the area, he observed vapors coming from the top of railcar DBCX 201581. The DGO also observed liquid streaming down the sides and onto the ground.  Upon closer investigation, liquid was observed coming from the combination housing. The combination housing was secured by seal # A3784563. The seal was removed and the combination housing opened. Liquid was observed coming from the base of the liquid line valve were it connects to the pressure plate. The valve was able to be shifted by hand. Heavy corrosion was observed on the liquid line valve fastener bolts.  The internal pressure was relieved which stopped the release of product.

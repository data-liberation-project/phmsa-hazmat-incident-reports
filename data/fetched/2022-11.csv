ERTS dispatched contractors to assess the trailer. Contractors arrived onsite and allowed the trailer to air out, then made entry into the trailer. They used a 5 gas meter and reported no readings for LEL. O2 was in a good level as well. Crew found 3 large tanks containing UN2363 Ethyl Mercaptan but had no signs of a leak. The cylinders were separated in the parking lot outside. Contractors conducted a soap test, but it did not produce any results of leaks. A 5 gas was placed close to the valve of one of the tanks and a 1.3ppm reading of H2S was recorded. Crew recommend that the trailer be left open over night to air out and that the tanks be left outside to off gas. A final reading on the tanks was taken and the H2S was down to 0.6ppm. The tanks were coned off and terminal personnel directed to stay clear of the area. No waste was generated.

The spill consisted of a UN1866 resin solution, likely damaged due to improper loading as the contents were found along the walls of the trailer and the drum was dented along the side, resulting in approximately 0.5 gallons released. Hepaco was dispatched to the site. Upon the contractor’s arrival, personnel observed a 1 ft-by 2ft area of wood trailer floor that was impacted by the released material. Hepaco personnel stated that the damaged container was not present. Hepaco personnel applied a degreaser to the impacted area and used absorbent pads to wipe down the residue. The spent absorbent pads were placed into one (1) 55-gallon metal drum.

We worked with the shipper who authorized us to do a partial delivery.  The driver was not familiar with the process of doing a partial delivery.  When the receiver told her to stop the tank was completely full instead of leaving 10% headspace like we requested.  This means she could not use her airline to blow the lines clear through what we call the bleeder valve system.  She now had to do a 'wet break' which she was unfamiliar with and did not stop and call one of our safety representatives for guidance.  She opened the bleeder valve and let product drain off until it stopped.  However she never walked the hoses to the bleeder valve to drain off additional product.  We recommend draining off 5 gallons in to buckets to ensure there is sufficient headspace in the hose when disconnecting from the highest point first.  Since this was not done when the hose was disconnected product rushed out the end of the delivery hose and overshot her spill bucket and on to the ground.  After she capped off that hose end she went to disconnect from the customer fill line and again a little product splashed out again.,"The customer ordered too much product.  We are working with them to discourage this process so we don't end up doing partial unloads.  Our driver was brought in for training refreshers on using her 'stop work authority' and call for assistance.   Internally when a customer says they have enough product and to not attempt delivery, we should follow that guidance vs tring to do partial deliveries.

RLW advised the containers were not damaged but released from a gasket/seal system not designed to support the container being inverted. Released material was collected by scraping the impacted snow and soil with a skid steer. All cargo was then transported to the XPO terminal located in Fridley, MN for continued shipment. The soil remaining was confirmed clean by the DOT and RLW with no further remediation needed. All contaminated soil, snow, and absorbents were placed into two 55-gallon poly drums and removed from site pending disposal. Please see attached photos (Appendix 2). On December 8, 2022, RLW returned to the spill site to complete confirmation soil sampling for TCLP Pesticides per MN Pollution Control Agency request.

While approaching an intersection on a 2-lane road, the Air Products driver remained in the right lane, with the intention of proceeding straight through the intersection. As the Air Products driver entered the intersection, a passenger sedan from the opposite lane of travel turned in front of the Air Products tractor, resulting in a collision. The force of the collision resulted in loss of control and a rollover. The trailer vessel cracked causing full release of product onto the roadway. Upon investigation the inner-outer vessel cracked at the front of the trailer from impact with roadway. Trailer lost vacuum and emptied 5673 liquid gallons of LIN within 2 hours. Photos of accident scene attached.  The NRC initial report did state that at least one person was taken to hospital for treatment, however this was a result of the accident and not the hazmat release.","Investigation is ongoing, current insurance hold on the tractor/trailer.

This road contains many narrow curves. While navigating the route the driver reported an encounter with another vehicle ""hugging the centerline"" and moved as far over as possible to allow the oncoming vehicle to pass. Upon execution of this decision the driver! truck left the asphalt surfaced - hard pack of the roadway. Directly adjacent to the white fog line at the location of the accident was a substantial shoulder drop off of approximately 18 inches. Consequently, the driver attempted to correct the situation to quickly bring the truck back to the asphalt surface. The resulting improper procedure of over-steering caused the truck to rollover sideways onto the roadway resulting in contact with another vehicle traveling on the same road. Upon impact with the other vehicle our truck continued to move and came to rest on its side off the roadway. The accident resulted in the occupants of the other vehicle going to hospital to be checked out and later released. Our driver signed a letter of declination at the scene to be treated for injuries, but at the managers request visited the ER to be checked out for possible injuries and required post-accident drug! alcohol screening. The rollover caused a small crack in the piping of the CTMV and damage (denting) to the tank. The damage to the piping allowed the release of approximately 200 gallons of product in vapor form from the vessel. In order to correct the issue, product had to be removed from the tank in order to upright the vehicle. Our responding personnel were able to remove enough product by means of controlled flaring to allow the vehicle to be up righted, the leak was stopped allowing the safe removal of the vehicle and remaining product from the scene. Upon completed transfer of the CTMV back to the home facility the remaining product was removed from the vessel.","Currently, drivers are required to complete industry specific training, Hazmat training, rollover prevention training, road test upon hire before assignment of job duties to include operation of a CTMV.

Art noticed a few drops of liquid substance coming from under the trailer close to the king pin. Art immediately grabbed is spill kit and applied it to the area where the liquid was coming from. Art called the on call supervisor around 8:05pm to report to the management team on a possible leak containing Acetic Acid. Art was instructed to call Chemtrec at 8:15pm for further instructions. Chemtrec referred Republic Services to call Environmental Management to assist with the containment and transferring the tanker to another if needed. A replacement tanker was dispatched the following morning while Mr. Thatcher stayed with the contained tanker.

The event took place during cruising altitude and during main cabin service. The event was approximately an hour prior to landing, putting the event at approximately 14:45 pm to 15:00 pm. I, Flight Attendant#1 received a call from the back galley by FA#2. She notified me of a passenger who had a vaping device near the back of the plane, who complained to her that the device was becoming extremely hot in their pocket. The passenger was identified as a Mr. Kenneth Steven Snell, seat number 29E. FA asked if we should use the fire containment bag, and I agreed that would be best to contain the H/E condition being omitted by the vape device. In this report there was a question for what occurred (Fire, Fumes/Odor, or smoke), there was no option for H/E conditions so I selected smoke, however, no smoke came from the device. The event was only a High Energy condition A event(overheating but no smoke or fire). The fire containment bag was delivered to the FAs in the back galley to treat and contain the over heating vape device. The bag was then stored in an empty cart in the back galley and monitored by FA 2,3 and 4. The Captain was notified immediately after the fire containment bag was donned. No escalating conditions occurred during flight. Upon arrival at Miami international airport, the gate agent's were immediately notified and a flight service manager came onboard to get a report of the event. Upon all passengers deplaning, the fire containment bag was removed by the flight services manager for record and documentation. Request for new equipment was placed for the aircraft as well. The vaping product was an""MBox vape"" by Athena Vapors. Item was cool to the touch after being treated and contained. No other incidents and no injuries occurred in this event.

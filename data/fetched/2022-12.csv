The car was isolated, and the shipper, National Response Center, and Kentucky EOC were notified. (CHEMTREC Report # 2022-1201-00083). Quick Response, a CSXT approved hazardous material contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the bottom outlet valve flange inadequately secured to affect a proper seal between the valve and the bottom of the tank car resulting in a release of hazardous materials. The issue was identified, and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative, Mr. Randy Shilling, 832-783-6428. Containment was positioned under the leaking valve and attempts were made to secure the tank in accordance with 49 CFR 173.31, all released material was cleaned from the exterior of the car, and the car was placed on hazmat hold. This incident did not require a special switching move. 7.1 not required.

The ruptures allowed roughly 7800 of the the total 8000 gallons to spill onto the roadway and into the ditch on the side of the roadway.  9-11 was promptly called and services arrived at the scene within minutes.  EMT's checked the driver.  TX State Trooper performed the accident investigation.  TX Dot put out cones for lane closures and dumped sand into the ditch to keep materiels from running.","Safety meetings will be conducted, stressing the importance of safe driving in incliment weather situations.

The package was unload off the trailer with no issue. Then as the package was being lifted and placed on a tugger cart, it was dropped on it's side. The package then leaked liquid. I would guess that the inner bag of the package must have already leaked out into the general cylinder prior to it being dropped by the package handler. DescribePack: The seal obviously was not working properly, because it should have prevented liquid from leaking out. also there was insufficient package material. The drum itself was only about 35% full, and then the just put one little thing of bubble wrap in it. They did not fill all the air space within the container to make it more damage resistant. There was also two separate sets of OP-900 Hazmat Documents on the package, making it difficult to determine what the actual content were. The two sets of documents had different track ids and different UN numbers. Both track ids were picked up from the same shipper on the same day. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: Once the spill was brought to my attention, the drum had already been turned back upright and was no longer leaking. I put on ppe and moved the leaking package and other affected packages away from the site. Then I covered all the leaked liquid with chemical neutralizer. Then I called the hazmat hotline. They sent a vendor out here to finish clean up. The vendor cleaned up the neutralizer from the spill area, as well as treated the packages that the chemical spilled on. They removed the leaking drum from our building in a larger drum. The other affected packages that were treated by the vendor were to large to be returned to the shipper, so those were scrapped.",No comments provided.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Fedex Ground Package System, Inc.",US,

The tanker was holding UN2789 Acetic Acid and it was unknown where the leak was coming from, but it was likely from the dome lid or crash box. On 12/11/22, at 2030 ET, Cleaning Guys (CG) arrived on site and assessed the impact areas.  The tanker was rolled on its side but at the time, it didn’t look like there was an active leak. CG estimated 3500 gallons of product spilled on the lot in a 12ft by 20ft yard area. There were several potholes in the lot where product as well as rainwater was pooling.  Since the tanker was surrounded by released product, CG could not access the tanker. CG had their skid steer en route along with the rest of the crew to scrape up the impacted parking lot, which is a soil gravel mix instead of concrete, and pile it to the side on poly sheets until they can get roll-off boxes on site.  CG was bringing a Betz Valve to assist in transferring the tanker’s remaining contents into another tanker.  A vacuum truck was also required and is en route.  The vacuum truck will be used to remove the collected product and water from the parking lot.  Then the soil will be scraped.  The liquid-collected waste will be placed into a frac tank on site until disposal can be coordinated.  The Schneider dispatched wrecking company could not perform the uprighting of the trailer.  CG dispatched Beards Towing.  CG pH tested the standing water, and it came out to a 4 so the material is safe for their frac tank.  At 0000 ET, the vacuum truck arrived, and the pumping began.  At 0205 ET, the wreckers were on site.  The tanker was uprighted at 0242 ET.  The crew began to transfer the remaining product from the damaged tanker.  At 0500 ET, CG completed the transfer.  CG placed a berm around the damaged trailer to prevent any leaking.  CG placed the impacted gravel piled on a poly sheet and will order roll-off boxes to containerize. The relief tanker departed the site.  At this point, it is estimated that approximately 8000 gallons of impacted water and 30 yards of impacted soil will be disposed of.  The site was secured for the crew to return for the remaining work.   On 12/12/22 at 1235 ET, CG returned to the site to pH spot sample the puddles to determine if any water needs to be pumped and take a water sample from the creek/pond to determine if there is any impact there.  All readings were neutral. The pond is approximately 1500ft from the spill site. ERTS reached out to Schneider and determined the original amount in the tanker was 5389 gallons.  At 1302 ET, TCEQ Will Daughtrey, called and was updated on the progress.  He also stated the TCEQ will only require confirmation pH sampling taken to a lab to show the areas in question being below the background areas.  Mr. Daughtrey visited the site and assessed the site in person.

The reason why I am inspecting is because we do not use drum to return damaged item back to the shipper. Before opening the drum, I went ahead to search for the damage package report on OP2 to see what the items in the drum are. When I found the item name in the description and see there is only one damaged item out of four. I went ahead and put on proper PPE to inspect the damaged item. There were four items in a bag with an invoice and SDS. There is no packing material to keep the items in place. Since there was a SDS in the drum, I went to section 14 to confirm this is a nonhazardous item, but it is regulated by the DOT. I did my own DPR using the drum as a packaging to avoid assumptions on the original box and process an ISF. DescribePack: There is a crack by the handle on the container.

It is assumed that another employee mistakenly punctured a 55 gallon plastic drum when it was being loaded onto the trailer the day before. The drum was placed immediately on its side to prevent it from leaking further and then was overpacked into an 851A2 salvage drum to continue transportation to the ultimate disposal facility.     The drum leaked about 1/2 gallon of class 9 material with waste chromium solution. The liquid was cleaned up with spill pads and absorbent and the drum was overpacked into an appropriate 85 gallon salvage drum along with the clean up materials. The duration of release is anticipated to be about 24 hours but due to the small hole, only about 1/2 a gallon leaked. The drum was still substantially full when the leak was discovered.   On 12/08/2022 the Veolia safety manager was notified and an investigation was performed. The results of the investigation revealed that a newer employee was assisting another employee with the shipment. The trailer was being filled with containers and the employee was not immediately aware that they had poked a hole in the drum until notified the following day by Veolia EHS.",Human error was identified as the cause of the incident. The two employees who loaded the trailer were notified of the leak and reminded to be more careful when loading drums with a drum cart.,No,,,,No,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

While pulling into the gate, a battery charger belonging to the Customer seated in seat 8D appeared to be smoking.  Once parked at the gate the flight crew began the emergency evacuation checklist, and made the ""Cabin Crew at Stations"" call, but did not give the ""EASY VICTOR"" command (the command to begin an evacuation).  The Captain went back into the cabin and used a halon fire extinguisher and cold water to cool the unit down.  Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) had been contacted and were on the jet bridge when the main boarding door was opened.  Before the jet bridge was attached, Customers opened the over-wing emergency exit doors, apparently without instructions from the crew.  Both the right and left doors were opened resulting in deployments of both over-wing slides.  Approximately 63 Customers exited the aircraft via the slides with the remainder exiting the aircraft through the main boarding door and Jet Bridge.  During an initial review of closed-circuit television footage from the gate area, it was noted that a large number of customers climbed out of the over-wing doors and went down the slides with large roller board or similar luggage in hand.  There were no serious injuries reported among the 128 customers and 6 crewmembers.  Three customers reportedly were evaluated by emergency medical personnel for smoke inhalation and two others for elbow pain.  All five were cleared without further treatment.  There was no significant damage reported to the aircraft.

ANALYST, HAZMAT/DG COMPLIANCE",1 SKYVIEW DRIVE,Fort Worth,TX,76155,Carrier,A passengers vape device caught fire in his bag under his seat and started to bum with his personal belongings. Passengers in the aft cabin yelled fire and I looked up and could see smoke in the aft cabin. Flight Attendant was working the cart during a service with another Flight Attendant. We pushed the cart immediately into the first class galley and one Flight Attendant grabbed the PBE and another Flight Attendant grabbed the fire extinguisher from the stowage spot. Flight Attendant just grabbed the first extinguisher they found since they didn't know at this time what kind of fire we were dealing with and didn't want to run to the back with nothing and then have to go back for an extinguisher thus possibly wasting valuable time. We arrived to the aft cabin and by this time another passenger who happened to be a Federal Air Marshall had already grabbed the device and placed it in the mid cabin Iavatory sink. We made sure the fire was out by continuing to run water on it while we went through the passengers bag to ensure that it was also no longer a threat. The passenger was totally compliant and admitted it was his device and offered any assistance we needed. After the fire was out we calmed down a few concerned passengers and Flight Attendant #4 who was a bit shaken and then resumed our duties. No one was hurt and we landed safely in L.A.

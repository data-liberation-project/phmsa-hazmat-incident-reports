The package that we received contained a Non-classified explosive material, that should have been shipped on a DOT-SP 8451 special permit pipe. The material arrived to our facility in a standard Uline 12x12x12 fiberboard box. These boxes are not UN popped for Hazardous materials. Inside that box was a FedEx ""Small Box"", that contained paperwork and 7 live explosive parts.   Once opened the package was separated into different holding area for examination. As this was a return shipment to out facility, thankfully the parts were sealed in the factory ESD bags with labels.   There were no hazardous material labels affixed to the outside of the container. No DG forms were completed.   Because of the untested nature of the parts, they were required to be shipped in a DOT-SP 8451 special permit   pipe. That pipe, per the permit should be, either a 4"" or 6"" schedule 80 seamless pipe, with closures at both ends, rated for containment of 25 g PETN. Also, the specific label should have read, Articles, explosive, n.o.s (*), 1.4E.","We immediately notified the Shipping Manager for Meggitt Safety Systems of the shipment.

He called the Brewster Yardmaster who then called myself, John Vergis, Hazardous Materials Officer for the WLE.  I came out to look at the car and found that the bottom outlet valve of the car was indeed leaking through the valve cap.  The valve handle was in the closed position and would not close any more.  It was a disengaging ball valve.  I removed the seal from the valve handle #1880761 and the valve stem #1880762, so that I could try to cycle the valve to see if I could get the leak to stop.    I could not get the valve to move in either direction either with the valve handle or with a pipe wrench directly on the valve stem. I tried to tighten the valve cap with a 36"" pipe wrench but I could not get it any more tight and the leak would not stop.  I put containment under the leaking valve and called Specialized Professional Services out of Washington , PA to come out to transload the car into another rail car.  They arrived about 2300 hrs. to transload and completed the transload about 0600 the next morning. On Monday, 7-8-2024, SPSI came back out to clean the interior of the car so that it could go back to the MarkWest plant in Jewett to be repaired.  After it was cleaned, I removed the bottom outlet cap and with a 36"" pipe wrench, and a second person, we were able to get the valve to open.  I looked up into the valve and saw that the nylon seal on the ball was shredded which was the cause of the leak.",I am not sure this would have been found right away.,No,,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway,US,

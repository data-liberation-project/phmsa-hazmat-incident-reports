The material arrived to our facility in a standard Uline 12x12x12 fiberboard box. These boxes are not UN popped for Hazardous materials. Inside that box was a FedEx ""Small Box"", that contained paperwork and 7 live explosive parts.   Once opened the package was separated into different holding area for examination. As this was a return shipment to out facility, thankfully the parts were sealed in the factory ESD bags with labels.   There were no hazardous material labels affixed to the outside of the container. No DG forms were completed.   Because of the untested nature of the parts, they were required to be shipped in a DOT-SP 8451 special permit   pipe. That pipe, per the permit should be, either a 4"" or 6"" schedule 80 seamless pipe, with closures at both ends, rated for containment of 25 g PETN. Also, the specific label should have read, Articles, explosive, n.o.s (*), 1.4E.","We immediately notified the Shipping Manager for Meggitt Safety Systems of the shipment.

The train was led my four locomotives.  Brakes were applied to the locomotives only and allowed to release on the remainder of the train.  This caused a great deal of force in the train that allowed the cars to leave the track.  Rail dislodged during the derailment impacted the fuel tank of the third from lead locomotive causing it to spill its contents of fuel.  Three of the four locomotives derailed as well as five of the 96 loaded ore cars.  No other material was spilled, the remaining locomotives had no leaks.    Internal responders were notified and responded to the derailment.  The spill response plan was followed alerting the required agencies.  A derailment contractor was called in to re-rail the train, and internal forces were assembled to repair the track.  The liquid product on the ground was collected as quickly as possible into buckets, however most of the product entered the ballast and surrounding soil.  The nearby river was monitored for signs of a sheen, inlets were checked but it was found the fuel had not reached either.  A spill contractor was dispatched to provide lined dumpsters for the contaminated soil.  The contractor also provided a vacuum truck to clean up the track area that could not be reached with an excavator.  Contaminated soil was placed in the lined dumpsters.  Dumpsters are staged for pickup when manifests are created and samples are analyzed.   The area of the spill will be restored with new ballast.  Any recovered fuel will be filtered and re-used elsewhere on the railroad.   The locomotive with the broken fuel tank was checked in the morning and recorded to have about 900 gallons of fuel before the trip.  40 gallons were recovered from the tank before re-railing the locomotive.  The maximum amount spilled would be approximately 860 gallons, however some of that amount was likely used in transit between the start of duty and the derailment.",NO COMMENT PROVIDED,Yes,,,,No,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,0,Stephen Hudspeth,US,

He called the Brewster Yardmaster who then called myself, John Vergis, Hazardous Materials Officer for the WLE.  I came out to look at the car and found that the bottom outlet valve of the car was indeed leaking through the valve cap.  The valve handle was in the closed position and would not close any more.  It was a disengaging ball valve.  I removed the seal from the valve handle #1880761 and the valve stem #1880762, so that I could try to cycle the valve to see if I could get the leak to stop.    I could not get the valve to move in either direction either with the valve handle or with a pipe wrench directly on the valve stem. I tried to tighten the valve cap with a 36"" pipe wrench but I could not get it any more tight and the leak would not stop.  I put containment under the leaking valve and called Specialized Professional Services out of Washington , PA to come out to transload the car into another rail car.  They arrived about 2300 hrs. to transload and completed the transload about 0600 the next morning. On Monday, 7-8-2024, SPSI came back out to clean the interior of the car so that it could go back to the MarkWest plant in Jewett to be repaired.  After it was cleaned, I removed the bottom outlet cap and with a 36"" pipe wrench, and a second person, we were able to get the valve to open.  I looked up into the valve and saw that the nylon seal on the ball was shredded which was the cause of the leak.",I am not sure this would have been found right away.,No,,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway,US,

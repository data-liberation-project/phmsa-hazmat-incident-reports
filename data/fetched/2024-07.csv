The material arrived to our facility in a standard Uline 12x12x12 fiberboard box. These boxes are not UN popped for Hazardous materials. Inside that box was a FedEx ""Small Box"", that contained paperwork and 7 live explosive parts.   Once opened the package was separated into different holding area for examination. As this was a return shipment to out facility, thankfully the parts were sealed in the factory ESD bags with labels.   There were no hazardous material labels affixed to the outside of the container. No DG forms were completed.   Because of the untested nature of the parts, they were required to be shipped in a DOT-SP 8451 special permit   pipe. That pipe, per the permit should be, either a 4"" or 6"" schedule 80 seamless pipe, with closures at both ends, rated for containment of 25 g PETN. Also, the specific label should have read, Articles, explosive, n.o.s (*), 1.4E.","We immediately notified the Shipping Manager for Meggitt Safety Systems of the shipment.

(Asphalt), leaking from under the jacket at the B-end brake support bracket onto the break assembly. The car was isolated and the shipper, Marathon Petroleum, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report #2024-0710-0049). Quick Response, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found product had leaked from under the jacket onto the brake assembly support but turned viscous as it cooled down and was malleable but solid. Subsequent investigation determined that the product released from the car due to a crack in the tank shell.

When I reached Lake Havasa, AZ it was a temperature of 125 degrees F. I reached the truck stop Pilots in Lake Havasa to take a 30 minute break and did a trailer inspection on the trailer 1145. I noticed the trailer was leaking the product out of the top of the tank. I rushed to grab some trash cans that the truck stop had next to my trailer to catch any liquid that was draining down the side of the tank. I climbed up the ladder to inspect where the leak was coming from and noticed it was leaking from the ARV Valve and also had 40 PSI of pressure and nowhere to relieve the pressure from. I cleaned up the tank and kept an eye on it and waited for temps to cool down. Once the temps cooled down I was able to relieve the pressure from the domes by cracking one of the ears. All the pressure was relieved and the leak stopped and was contained until the HAZMAT team showed up at 0900 in the morning to clean up.",- COMMUNICATE WITH SHIPPER AND CONFIRM UNIT IS NOT OVERLOADED. - SECURE THE LOAD AND REVIEW FOR POTENTIAL PRESSURE BUILD UP.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"ECOLOGY CONTROL INDUSTRIES, INC",US,

There was a foul odor coming from the vehicle which smelled like vinegar. The bulk truck was pulled off the door and parked in the yard with the back door left open in order to air it out. Later during the sort, the bulk truck was put back on door however the odor did not dissipate. Once some packages were pulled out, the spill was evident. Blue dye was all over the floor on the right side of the vehicle. A(formerly) white pail was on its side with the top cap open. The pail was covered in blue dye which covered the label and any other information. We started pulling out the leaked-on packages and came across a second white pail which was identical to the first and listed as 1 of 2. Upon inspection, a Corrosive Class 8 diamond label was discovered on the side of the pail. There were SDS sheets attached to the pail. Also on the pail was a manufacturing label which listed UN#, DOT shipping name of material, Technical name, Hazardous Class and Packing Group. No Hazardous Materials Certification Form was submitted, no OP-900LL on the pail and there was no""HAZ"" marking on the FXG shipping label. The shipper shipped this as an Undeclared Hazmat(TRACKING#777176962630). This shipment was classified as a PGI. Since we were dealing with a high danger hazmat and all 6 gallons had spilled out, it was determined that any intemal attempt at cleanup was beyond our capabilities and this incident needed to be reported. My first call was to the Emergency Spill number listed on the container which is required of the shipper. The company listed was CHEMTREC 1-800-424-9300. I filed a spill incident report with them and received a report number(#224070300268). They then instructed me to contact our company's Emergency Spill Response Service. The spill met the criteria listed for our FXG Emergency Spill Response Service 1-833-394-7745. Once contacted, I provided them with all the information that they required, and they assigned Alert#212661 to our request for assistance.

The employee notified the Waterloo Yard Master who in turn notified the CN Dangerous Goods Team. The tank car was set out to an isolation track (WA90) for inspection by a CN emergency response contractor. A CN emergency response contractor was dispatched to the location for mitigation. The contractor performed an inspection of the tank car and found the bottom outlet valve to be leaking from the threads of the bottom outlet valve cap. It was determined that there was a failure in the sealing surface of the valve seat to include a defective gasket. (The BOV cap was found to be less than tool tight and the BOV in the closed position and pinned upon initial inspection). CN emergency response contractor did observe cable seal to be correctly in place. The BOV cap was removed, and it was observed to be leaking past the closed ball. The BOV valve handle was cycled several times to the open and closed position to free any debris that may have been trapped in the BOV sealing surface potentially causing the leak. The BOV cap was then removed and observed for 20 minutes to ensure there was no further leakage from the valve. It was noted that the BOV cap gasket was deformed and was replaced. The bottom outlet valve cap was then re-installed and tightened with a 36"" pipe wrench. Upon tightening the BOV cap, CN emergency response contractor proceeded to place new cable seals on the BOV / Cap.",No comments provided.,No,TANK CAR,,117R100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,18000,WC,US,

While intermodal container was staged at the STG Logistics yard, a leak was discovered coming from the back of container. Area was isolated and United States Environmental Services was dispatched to perform cleanup. Louisiana DEQ responded to assess. Upon opening container, one 55-gallon drum was discovered with a faulty seam. Approximately 1 gallon had released from the drum, which impacted the container floor and minimal amount to gravel surface beneath. Due to the nature of the product, the product evaporated upon contact with the air, and no cleanup was required. Absorbent pads were utilized as a precautionary measure, damaged drum was overpacked into an 85-gallon overpack, and all cleanup debris was placed within overpack drum.

The train was led my four locomotives.  Brakes were applied to the locomotives only and allowed to release on the remainder of the train.  This caused a great deal of force in the train that allowed the cars to leave the track.  Rail dislodged during the derailment impacted the fuel tank of the third from lead locomotive causing it to spill its contents of fuel.  Three of the four locomotives derailed as well as five of the 96 loaded ore cars.  No other material was spilled, the remaining locomotives had no leaks.    Internal responders were notified and responded to the derailment.  The spill response plan was followed alerting the required agencies.  A derailment contractor was called in to re-rail the train, and internal forces were assembled to repair the track.  The liquid product on the ground was collected as quickly as possible into buckets, however most of the product entered the ballast and surrounding soil.  The nearby river was monitored for signs of a sheen, inlets were checked but it was found the fuel had not reached either.  A spill contractor was dispatched to provide lined dumpsters for the contaminated soil.  The contractor also provided a vacuum truck to clean up the track area that could not be reached with an excavator.  Contaminated soil was placed in the lined dumpsters.  Dumpsters are staged for pickup when manifests are created and samples are analyzed.   The area of the spill will be restored with new ballast.  Any recovered fuel will be filtered and re-used elsewhere on the railroad.   The locomotive with the broken fuel tank was checked in the morning and recorded to have about 900 gallons of fuel before the trip.  40 gallons were recovered from the tank before re-railing the locomotive.  The maximum amount spilled would be approximately 860 gallons, however some of that amount was likely used in transit between the start of duty and the derailment.",NO COMMENT PROVIDED,Yes,,,,No,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,0,Stephen Hudspeth,US,

He called the Brewster Yardmaster who then called myself, John Vergis, Hazardous Materials Officer for the WLE.  I came out to look at the car and found that the bottom outlet valve of the car was indeed leaking through the valve cap.  The valve handle was in the closed position and would not close any more.  It was a disengaging ball valve.  I removed the seal from the valve handle #1880761 and the valve stem #1880762, so that I could try to cycle the valve to see if I could get the leak to stop.    I could not get the valve to move in either direction either with the valve handle or with a pipe wrench directly on the valve stem. I tried to tighten the valve cap with a 36"" pipe wrench but I could not get it any more tight and the leak would not stop.  I put containment under the leaking valve and called Specialized Professional Services out of Washington , PA to come out to transload the car into another rail car.  They arrived about 2300 hrs. to transload and completed the transload about 0600 the next morning. On Monday, 7-8-2024, SPSI came back out to clean the interior of the car so that it could go back to the MarkWest plant in Jewett to be repaired.  After it was cleaned, I removed the bottom outlet cap and with a 36"" pipe wrench, and a second person, we were able to get the valve to open.  I looked up into the valve and saw that the nylon seal on the ball was shredded which was the cause of the leak.",I am not sure this would have been found right away.,No,,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway,US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, Altivia Chemical, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report #2024-07-09-00182). EnviroServe, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and determined the VRV was faulty.  Contractor personnel removed the defective vacuum relief valve and applied a securement plug to stop the vapor release.

Derailed cars included six loaded tank cars transporting UN1230, Methanol, 3, PG II, RQ (Methanol), eleven loaded tank cars transporting UN1005, Ammonia, Anhydrous, 2.3(8), Toxic Inhalation Hazard, Zone D, Marine Pollutant (Ammonia, Anhydrous), RQ (Ammonia), and twelve loaded hopper cars transporting non-hazmat Polyethylene pellets. CPKC mobilized internal and railroad qualified external resources to investigate the damage and mitigate released lading. Fire was reported immediately after the derailment, with multiple cars on fire. Many of the derailed tank cars experienced heat impingement. Because of this, pressure built within tank cars caused pressure relief devices to release product into the atmosphere.  Additionally, releases occurred from holes and punctures in tank shells, and from damage incurred to manways, valves, pressure regulating devices, and other tank car appurtenances. The NTSB is investigating this incident and has requested that CPKC refrain from modifying any tank cars until it has completed its work.  Because of this, CPKC has not been able to fully assess damage which might have occurred under tank jackets. The following information is the best information available at this time.

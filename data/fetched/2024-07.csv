The package that we received contained a Non-classified explosive material, that should have been shipped on a DOT-SP 8451 special permit pipe. The material arrived to our facility in a standard Uline 12x12x12 fiberboard box. These boxes are not UN popped for Hazardous materials. Inside that box was a FedEx ""Small Box"", that contained paperwork and 7 live explosive parts.   Once opened the package was separated into different holding area for examination. As this was a return shipment to out facility, thankfully the parts were sealed in the factory ESD bags with labels.   There were no hazardous material labels affixed to the outside of the container. No DG forms were completed.   Because of the untested nature of the parts, they were required to be shipped in a DOT-SP 8451 special permit   pipe. That pipe, per the permit should be, either a 4"" or 6"" schedule 80 seamless pipe, with closures at both ends, rated for containment of 25 g PETN. Also, the specific label should have read, Articles, explosive, n.o.s (*), 1.4E.","We immediately notified the Shipping Manager for Meggitt Safety Systems of the shipment.

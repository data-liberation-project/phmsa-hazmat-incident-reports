He was on Interstate 25 Southbound in Albuquerque, NM when he struck a piece of road debris. This road debris punctured a hole in the saddle bag tank of his Tractor. Driver pulled over to check the damage near I-25 exit 221. At this time he sees the damage to the fuel tank and fuel leaking from it. He called 911 for help FD showed up in roughly 5 minutes and was able to patch the hole in the tank. Roughly 50 gallons was released onto the concrete and dirt where the unit was stopped. Once Solar Dispatch was contacted we dispatched Environmental Restoration to the scene for clean up. Once on site they determined the Fire Dept had cleaned the impacted concrete but the spill had migrated to the soil and roughly 30 feet down the hill that is in the area. The clean up crew deployed granular absorbents to soil to soak up any fuel and protect against any further migration. They also took soil samples at the site and determined the product seeped down 6 inches into the soil. Excavation of the area has been scheduled but Environmental Restoration and is going to take place on Thursday June 19th.",Driver was trained on Smith System with focus on eye lead time. Also we are speaking with the tractor manufacturer to see if anything can be done to protect the tanks.,No,                             ,,,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,36150,"SOLE TRANSPORT, L.L.C.",US,

Contractors were dispatched to the site to perform all onsite clean-up activities. Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of 5.0 gallons of ABC FORMULA 300 (UN1760, 8, III) from (1) 275-gallon poly tote onto the trailer floor. The release was reportedly due to the cage rubbing against the plastic tote bladder and creating a hole in the tote, impacting a 26’ x 6’ area of the trailer floor. No drains or waterways were impacted by the release. The release was neutralized then cleaned with absorbents and the proper PPE. Contractors transferred the remaining product from the damaged tote into a new, clean tote and proceeded to shred the damaged tote.

The adhesive seems to have oozed out of the pail and spread under the pallet and seeped through the floor boards of the trailer but then coagulated into stal actites under the trailer before hitting the yard. The operations supervisor was unsure if any actually hit the yard. The pail appears to have failed under the weight of the freight above it but the operations supervisor advised that he did not see any other damage however the pallet is wrapped and some of the adhesive oozed out under the wrap so it may have been the top cover of the pail that failed. Safety advised CURA would be contacted for remediation and to make sure nothing hit the yard.~~Called CURA and spoke with Candice who advised a crew will be sent out and will check the yard and p ower wash if needed.,Review handling of hazardous materials with loading crew and advise to inspect freight before loading.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,160,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,ABF Freight,US,

I delivered it to him, he got the shipment ready to be shipped out to SLC, and then I started creating an AWB for him. I asked about any lithium batteries, he said yes and that his boss asked him to connect all the batteries to the tools when he received it. I found out that he had 5 lithium batteries in one container(toolbox), and he didn't know of the watts. He said the batteries were declared in DLG, we went and looked at the shipment and I did not see any UN 3481 labels on the container but there was a NOTOC label dated for today. Customer then opened up the shipment and looked at the watts, finding 1 lithium battery at 140wh. I advised that was over the allowed limit for shipping through Cargo and will have to take it out. He then went through another container(tote) and found 2 more spare lithium batteries by themselves. He had 4 tools total, I instructed he connect the batteries to the tools and separate to 2 tools per container. He took away 3 spare lithium batteries from the shipment, 1 of which was over the limit.

Hepaco personnel removed all the freight from the trailer. Most of the product was at the nose of the trailer. The pH test revealed it was 0. Soda ash was deployed to neutralize the affected areas. The new pH reading for the trailer was 8-9. Three (3) 55-gallon poly drums were used to containerize empty jugs, impacted cardboard, bolts, fasteners, plastic wrap, absorbent pads, and PPE. Contractor personnel had to return to site because the terminal reported one of the drums reacted. All the drums were moved outside and filled with water under the supervision of the fire department. While Hepaco personnel waited for the temperature of the drums to cool down, they clean-up the affected concrete on the dock. The contents were contained into one (1) 55-gallon poly drum and filled with water. After the temperature of the drums lowered, the terminal manager and chief of fire department declared the site was safe to leave.

ERTS reviewed the SDS with the terminal, and it was determined a contractor will be needed as a chemical respirator is required for cleanup.   Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 2-cups of UN1263 Cetcguard Thixo product released to the wooden trailer floor due to a load shift.

ABF Supervisor states that the leak is currently contained on the trailer and hasn't spilled out onto the yard. Safety did not advise Supervisor to open up the trailer and investigate due to the various amounts of poison and corrosive hazmat items on the trailer that could also be  the culprit of the spill. Safety contacted CURA and they're dispatching a team out on emergency response to the spill. Cura reported one 5-gallon container of UN1155, Ethyl Ether, 3, I had been punctured and that a majority of the releasted Ethyl Ether had evaporated.

Contractors were dispatched to the site to perform all onsite clean-up activities. Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of 1-gallon of ShrinkPET HSPRO YELLOW (UN1210, 3, II) from (8) 1-gallon steel pails onto the trailer floor. The release was reportedly due to a load shift, impacting a 3’ x 4’ area of the trailer floor and damaging a 55-gallon DM of product. No drains or waterways were impacted by the release. The release was cleaned with absorbent pads and the proper PPE. The 55-gallon damaged DM of product was placed into an 85-gallon DM overpack and all other waste generated from addressing this release was containerized in (2) 55-gallon DMs. All waste was taken off-site by the contractor for proper disposal.",No comment provided.,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,6000,"EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND TRAINING SOLUTIONS, INCORPORATED",US,

During the inspection, Mr. Perkins detected an odor upon opening the protective housing cover on residue tank car FURX 134030. Mr. Perkins also detected a hissing sound coming from the B-end liquid valve assembly plug region.  Mr. Perkins turned the B-end liquid valve handle approximately one inch in the closed direction. The hissing noise gradually ended, and the detected odor began to dissipate.  Additionally, Mr. Perkins found the A-end liquid valve plug, and vapor valve plug less than tool tight.   A railroad qualified response contractor was mobilized to correct any defects. The A-end liquid valve plug, and vapor valve plug were secured tool tight.  All other closures were verified to be properly secured.  The shipper was notified and instructed to obtain an OTMA-1 to move the FURX 134030 to home shop for requalification.    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated based on the best information available at the time of filing.  This shipment was offered as a 'bulk' shipment, aka one car load, therefore the exact amount offered in this package is not known to the carrier. This carrier does not have access to mass balance data which can exactly quantify this value.","The SOO LINE RAILROAD COMPANY (DBA CPKC) notified shipper of this release. Continued emphasis with Offerors/Shippers is made to conduct thorough inspections prior to movement in order to reduce valve failures in the field. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with SOO Line Railroad (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Ed Dankbar, SOO Line Railroad, 120 S 6th ST STE 900, Minneapolis, MN 55402.

It was reported that approximately 5 gallons of ""Cadox M-50A"" were released from a cardboard box (possibly plastic jugs inside) due to a forklift puncture. The release impacted the concrete dock floor. ERTS reviewed the SDS with the caller and determined that terminal personnel are not capable of cleaning the release with PPE available on site.  Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 1-gallon UN3105 Cadox M-50A product released to the concrete dock floor due to forklift puncture impacting 5’x5’ area. The contractors broke down the pallet to remove the damaged containers and any impacted packaging material. The crew generated (2) 55-gallon poly drums and (1) 35-gallon poly drum containing the damaged plastic pails, oil dri, and impacted packaging material.

Emergency notification was made to the CN Dangerous Goods Team, who responded to the incident. The CN Dangerous Goods Officer noted a significant amount of solidified white product on the sides of the tank car emanating from within the closed protective housing upon arrival. The protective housing was found to be completely full of solidified product, with a small stream of liquid still leaking, making it impossible to locate the origin of the leak. The manway cover swing bolts were loosened in order to relieve the internal pressure, which stopped the leak. The solidified product from within the protective housing was removed by use of a pneumatic chipping hammer and hot water pressure washer. All fittings within the protective housing were found to be secure. As the car was no longer leaking, it was impossible to determine the origin of the leak.

The spill consists of approximately 10 ounces of Infused, which released from a 1 275-gallon plastic tote due to a loose lid that caused the product to slosh around and spill on the top of the tote and on the trailer floor. ERTS will dispatch a contractor to assist, as this is a corrosive liquid inside of a tote. No SDS could be located for this product.  Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 10-ounces of UN3264 Infused product released from a 275-gallon plastic tote to the top of the tote and an area of the wooden trailer floor (4’x4’) due to improper packaging & a loose cap.

It was reported that an unknown amount of battery acid UN2794 released from industrial battery due. The release impacted Door 9.  ERTS will proceed to dispatch a contractor to the site to complete cleanup activities.   XPO-XSO contacted ERTS regarding a large battery that tipped over in transit releasing battery acid onto the  trailer floor and dock floor. A contractor dispatched and observed an estimated 5-gallon release onto the entire  wooden trailer floor and an estimated 25-foot area on the concrete dock floor as a result of a load shift /  inadequate preparation for transportation. The contractor applied baking soda and oil dry to the release and  up righted the battery. One 55-gallon DF containing the neutralized spent absorbents and impacted shrink  wrap was generated for waste disposal. The Shipper does not want the batter back, so that was also labelled  for waste disposal. XPO will manage all waste created from the response.

He noticed that there was a leak coming from a front end of the trailer and immediately called our office. The driver told me he was going to delivery at 15780 Alamo Jct. Elmendorf, TX 78112, he missed the left turn towards the Alamo Jct. (coming from the north on Richter Rd) and kept going south on Richter Rd and did a multipoint turn. That's where the load shifted and one of the IBCs got punctured by dunnage (wooden pallet, hole size 2 by 4) that shipper loaded up all the way in front of the trailer. A leak started and the driver called us immediately.  If the shipper didn't load us with dunnage at the front of the trailer, the broken dunnage (pallet) wouldn't puncture the IBC even with the load shift that occurred. The duration of release was approximately 3hrs.  No injuries or other damage were reported. I called Chemtrec (ER contact) and they advised me to call the Receiver (Univar) because they were just 20 yards down the road to have them try to contain the spill. On-site Univar Solutions personnel deployed granular absorbents and soda ash to contain and neutralize the release. Additionally, an 85-gallon drum was placed under the leaking tote to provide further containment until crews arrived. At approximately 8:29 AM CDT, a representative from Univar Solutions (US) retained Cura Emergency Services, L.C. (CES) to manage the environmental remediation of the site on their behalf. Based on the available information, the CES incident manager dispatched a crew from Lone Star Hazmat (LSH) to assess and remediate the site as necessary.","Two major things that contributed to this spill were: 1: Driver's fault in which he went off the road to make a multi-point turn where the load shifted towards the front. 2: Stack of wooden pallets that were used as dunnage to offset the weight towards the center of the trailer.  On our end we will use this incident for training purposes and have the drivers trained on all the hazards and potential hazards that could drastically increase the probability of cargo damage/spill, so it won't reoccur again in the future.  Shipper should improve the safety awareness of how wrong load securement/bracing can endanger safety of the load and integrity of the containers loaded. Wooden pallets should not be used as dunnage because in case of minor load shift, they are first to be crushed by weight of the IBCs and first to puncture those IBCs like in this incident.",Yes,                             ,,,No,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,30790,MATRIX INC.,US,

The assessment of the tank car revealed that all 6 manway cover swing bolts were found to be less than tool-tight (easily turned by a gloved hand), preventing a proper seal of the manway cover, allowing the contents to leak during transportation. The manway cover was opened for gasket integrity inspection. The manway cover gasket was found to be intact without any noticeable defects.

Hazardous Materials Manager Tom Robinson was called for a response. Manager Robinson found AXLX 967 leaking from the pressure relief device at a very slow rate. The car was isolated in the haz mat track. HMM Robinson and a contractor used the crows foot wrench from the C-kit and tried to tighten the PRD mounting bolts. We were able to get a small turn on one of the bolts, however we thought the leak continued. The capping kit was applied to what we believed was a broken pressure relief device. The car was monitored for 48 hours and there was no pressure inside the can with the capping kit applied. A verbal OTMA was given to UPRR from Mark Maday with the FRA to move the car on ULIALR 4 on 5-4-2025.

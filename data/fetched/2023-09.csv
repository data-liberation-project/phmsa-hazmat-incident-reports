(Alkyl (C12-C14 Dimethylamine) UN2735 8, II) from a tanker.  Contractors were dispatched to clean up the release.  Upon arrival, contractors confirmed that the release was caused by loose flange bolts on the tanker and was contained to a 50' x 2' area of asphalt, and a 1' x 1' area of nearby soil. Contractors were able to clean up the release with absorbents, pad, and the proper PPE. They used hand tools to scrap the affected soil, and tightened the flange bolts, so the cargo could be forwarded on to the original consignee.  All waste generated was containerized in (2) 55-gallon poly drums which was then taken offsite by contractors for proper disposal.

The inspector notified the CN Dangerous Goods Officer who responded to the incident location. The CN Dangerous Goods Officer's inspection of tank car revealed liquid leaking from the gasket sealing surface between the manway nozzle and the manway cover plate indicating a possible gasket failure. The liquid on the side of the tank car previously noted by the FRA inspector was nearing the bottom side of the tank car when the CN DGO arrived. The nitrogen pad pressure was relieved from the tank car. The manway cover was then opened for gasket inspection purposes. The (6) manway cover swing bolt nuts required a 36"" pipe wrench and lubricating oil on the bolt threads to be loosened indicating the cover has not been opened for an extended period of time. The 20"" manway cover lid gasket was removed and inspected. The inspection revealed the gasket to be delaminated in several areas and showed signs of deterioration throughout. The lid gasket was replaced with a 20"" Teflon rim nozzle gasket and re-secured by the CN DGO. A response contractor decontaminated the tank car exterior and re-applied a nitrogen pad to the interior. The shipper listed on the waybill was notified of the incident through a Chemtrec report. The car will be released for continued transportation pending an OTMA 3 for an un-related defect.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,22251,Illinois Central,US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, National Response Center, and West Virginia DEP were notified.  (CHEMTREC Report #2023-0913-00015). Quick Response, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the fill hole cover closed however gasketing material was displaced and preventing a proper seal resulting in a vapor release of lading. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper, Mr. Rob Cline of Tetra Technologies, phone 304-482-7655. Contractor personnel properly installed the gasket and fill port cover without incident thus securing the release. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport.

Ashland Avenue,HOMEWOOD,IL,60430,Carrier,"A CN Mechanical employee observed liquid dripping from the bottom outlet valve cap of tank car # CTCX 731039 while perform rail car inspections on an inbound train at the CN Waterloo Yard in Waterloo, IA. The employee notified the on duty transportation manager who in turn made all internal notifications to initiate a response to the incident. A CN Dangerous Goods Officer performed an inspection of the tank car and found the bottom outlet valve to be leaking from the threads of the bottom outlet valve cap as a result of the BOV not creating a proper seal and the BOV cap not tight enough to contain the leak. (The BOV cap was found to be tool tight and the BOV valve in the fully closed position upon initial inspection). The BOV valve handle was cycled several times to the open and closed position to free any debris that may have been trapped in the BOV sealing surface potentially causing the leak. The leak persisted after cycling the valve. A 24"" pipe wrench was then used to turn the BOV operating stem in a counter clockwise direction in an attempt to further close the valve. The leak persisted after using the pipe wrench. A 36"" pipe wrench was used to further tighten the BOV cap to stop the leak. Tightening the BOV cap further stopped the leak. (Approximately 1/4 turn). The BOV cap was loosened but not fully removed to observe the leakage volume during the above attempts to fully seat the valve. The tank car will be transloaded, cleaned and purged prior to being released for transportation. 09-20-2023 The tank car was transloaded into a shipper provided empty tank car. It was then cleaned and purged of all hazardous material. The BOV cap was removed so the gasket could be inspected. The gasket was found to be severely damaged and cut which ultimately contributed to the leak.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED,No,TANK CAR,,117R100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,25002,GTW,US,

Additionally,  during routine switching operations a Conrail Conductor was splashed with acid from the improperly secured tank car. The Conductor was immediately brought in to remove affected clothing and shower of any impacted skin. No reportable injury was encountered as the Conductors and Terminal Supervisions actions removed all material before any health effects took place. The car was isolated and the shipper/consignee PVS was notified directly via phone. Enviroserve, an approved Conrail Contractor was notified to respond, inspect and secure the tank car. Enviroserve personnel, investigated the leak and found the source of the leak to be from the rupture disk assembly. Upon further inspection it was found that the inspection cap was hanging off the housing and no rupture disk was in place beneath the assembly. Additionally, there was no required surge protection on the rupture disk assembly. Enviroserve placed the appropriate rupture disk and resecured the assembly. The tank car was then held until the proper surge protection device could be placed in the assembly. Conrail and Enviroserve worked with the car owner and Steve Kuz, Alltrantec 519-718-8377 to secure the proper service equipment.

When the trailer overturned, it hit a small tree which had branches that entered the spill dam/ rollover protection area and hit the 3/4 inch air inlet line at the base of the Fort Valve PRD and broke the 3/4 inch stainless steel nipple for the air inlet line. There were no other package failures. At this point the cargo tank lost approximately 300 gallons, ER personnel would not allow us to stop the leak until there the tank was anchored by a recovery unit. We requested a tow truck to anchor it around 5:30 on Wed 9-13-2023, but one was never called. At approximately 7:00 PM, the incident commander decided to put off all efforts on hold until 7:30/8:00 AM the following morning due to location and darkness setting in. Due to no cell phone coverage in the area, we had requested ER personnel made all required ^ notifications to EPA, CaIOES, NRC, etc. California Highway Patrol was IC, Alameda Fire was on site, Ambulance, Fish and Wildlife, local environmental agency, the Sf Water district, etc were all onsite. At 07:30 on 9-14-23, a recovery 65 ton rotator arrived on site to secure the trailer. At approximately 8:30 we were allowed to do damage assessment on the trailer and found the source of the leak, drove a redwood plug onto it and stopped the leak. We then hooked up a 2 inch hose between the discharge line and a 70 barrel vacuum tank. By this time, since plugging was delayed, the cargo tank lost approximately 2,000 gallons of product. Tank was emptied, recovered and uprighted.",Better delivery instructions for these rural deliveries.

He said that someone helped him hose down the liquid when they read that the material was called ""Dishmachine Detergent.""  The driver gave the empty drum to QA and the inside of his truck was visible with pickups on the floor of the truck at that time.  There were no additional damages from that Work Area.  The following day, P&D was told that the spill occurred inside the delivery truck and that ""they had hosed it down"", but did not say when or where the spill occurred nor did they say who helped the driver clean up the truck since the Hazmat had been the only damaged package to return to the station.

The employees tried to use a pallet jack but were unable to get it under the  pallet. The employees proceeded to take one drum at a time from off of the pallet and move them by  dolly. There was no sign or indication that the drum was leaking when the employees were moving the  drums. When the receiving facility employee moved the last drum, the bottom of the drum cracked.  The crack was a total failure (please see attached photo #1) and all fluid was released quickly  inside the trailer.  The fluids ran out of the trailer and onto the asphalt where it gathered along the cement curb.  Employees worked together and set down absorbent boom and pads to contain the waste from spreading  further. Fluids stayed onsite in the immediate area and didn't enter any waterways, public property  or roads. Internal response team from the facility cleaned up the spill. Waste materials were then collected and placed into new drums for disposal.","Drums were not provided by PPC. PPC will utilize a checklist to inspect drums and other containers  more from clients for transport. The PPC driver and a representative for the receiving company will use  the same checklist to verify the conditions of the drums and signs of leaking material inside the  truck before accepting and offloading the load.

Ops notified the Comm Center and the  airport fire department, which met the aircraft at the gate. We got the approval to pull the bridge  up to the aircraft as it was advised the fire was out. The fire department entered the aircraft and  determined it was safe to deplane the passengers.  A woman, seated in row 7, tote bag began to smoke and catch on fire. The tote bag had a vape pen, a  loose spare battery and a laptop in the tote bag. The flight attendants were quick to respond with  a fire extinguisher and a fire containment bag and were able to put the fire out as fast as  possible by using the fire containment bag to place the tote bag in it to stop the fire. The tote  bag sustained heavy damage. Determined the tote bag contained a vape pen, a loose spare battery,  and a laptop. Unsure if the vape pen or the loose battery began the thermal runaway as both were  heavily damaged. The laptop was in the early stages of melting.

Customer informed driver that they would complete unload process, driver returned to the cab of his truck. Customer employee began sample taking process and checked that external valve was closed before opening internal valve to take sample. Upon opening internal valve, an estimated quantity of approximately 50 gallons was released unexpectedly out of the hose connection point and into the customers containment area. Probable cause is external valve failure. Tanker will be fully inspected to confirm.","Tanker was taken back to Univar yard, cleaned and inspected. During inspection it was found that the internal valve was holding but the external valve was Ieaking. Once the external valve was removed you could see that there was a nut with a cotter pin that was missing. This was the cause of the release. On 9/28/2023 Cox Automotive came on site to Univar and fixed the valve. A new gasket and nut with cotter pin were put on the external valve where it had been missing.

The driver noticed that there was some liquid on the front of the trailer along with oily stains on the back of the trailer. Veolia personnel started to remove the drums from the trailer and identified the leaking drum which was located at the nose of the trailer. The leaking drum was a 55 gal metal drum with a pin hole leak that appeared to occur from potentially rubbing/impact against another drum during transportation which was a weak spot due to corrosion. The driver made multiple stops that day and he has stated that he did not notice any staining on the back-end of the trailer when he loaded addition drums at each stop. Also he did not notice any oily material near or around the front of the trailer during those stops. We are unsure of the duration of the spill but based on the quantity still left in the drum, roughly 5 gallons had leaked out. The drum was placed into a salvage drum and the spill clean up was completed by the Veolia in-house crew.  Most of the material was contained inside the trailer with minimal amounts outside of the trailer.  There was no evidence of a any spill on the ground itself.","Based on the investigation, the drums are stored outdoors at the customer site which contributed to some corrosion and likely caused some weak spots on the drum. The driver stated that there was some surface rust on the drum but nothing that may have compromised the drum itself. Veolia will review this incident with all employees in regards to checking the drum to make sure that it is not compromised and if there is any surface corrosion to further evaluate and potentially place in salvage drum prior to transportation when there is doubt.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, Advansix, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report 2023-10-01-00001). HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, as well as a CSXT Manager of Hazardous Materials, were dispatched to the scene and found product leaking through the pressure relief valve.  CSX and contractor personnel contained the release with application of an emergency capping kit until such time that the contents of the leaking car were transloaded into tank car NATX400291. Additionally, response personnel utilized a highway transport truck to unload approximately 4,000 liquid gallons of product that could not be safely loaded into the NATX 400291 due to volumetric outage constraints.  Because the leaking car was not equipped with a gauging device, response personnel were unable to determine the specific reason why the identified calf car could not accept the entire load; however, it is suspected that the NATX 400224 was originally overloaded prior to the pressure relief device failure.  Upon completion of the product transload, response personnel purged the leaking car to clean/empty status.  All issues identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper’s representative (Christian Beale 804-731-8124). While the car was suspected to be overloaded, the pressure relief device continued to leak for the duration of the unloading process- even at acceptable load volume and pressure.  Because of the this, the pressure relief device was identified as non-conforming and an AAR form QA 7.1 was filed.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,150100,JOe McCann,US,

The 14 gallon drum contained a 2.5 gallon glass bottle of Formic Acid With Not Less Than 5% But Less Than 10% Acid By Mass corrosive liquids. The outer container was opened and the inner container was inspected and was found to be broken and released its contents. No liquid was released from the outer packaging drum.   The 14 gallon drum containing the broken glass bottle was overpacked into an 30 gallon 1H2 drum and transportation to the ultimate disposal facility was continued. The drum did not leak any amount of the corrosive liquid solution out of the outer container.",On 9/28/2023 the Veolia safety manager was notified of the spill. The results of the investigation is the employee who packaged the container did not know that the maximum allowable size of a glass container is limited to one gallon.

After that conversation, Southeastern Freight Lines was contracted to pick up the shipment at origin address and move to our warehouse in East Point, GA. This air freight shipment was planned to be shipped on Turkish Airlines (TK) via passenger aircraft. 09/11/23: Southeastern Freight Lines picked up the two pallets from the shipper's facility.

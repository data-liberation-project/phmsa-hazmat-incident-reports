(Alkyl (C12-C14 Dimethylamine) UN2735 8, II) from a tanker.  Contractors were dispatched to clean up the release.  Upon arrival, contractors confirmed that the release was caused by loose flange bolts on the tanker and was contained to a 50' x 2' area of asphalt, and a 1' x 1' area of nearby soil. Contractors were able to clean up the release with absorbents, pad, and the proper PPE. They used hand tools to scrap the affected soil, and tightened the flange bolts, so the cargo could be forwarded on to the original consignee.  All waste generated was containerized in (2) 55-gallon poly drums which was then taken offsite by contractors for proper disposal.

When the trailer overturned, it hit a small tree which had branches that entered the spill dam/ rollover protection area and hit the 3/4 inch air inlet line at the base of the Fort Valve PRD and broke the 3/4 inch stainless steel nipple for the air inlet line. There were no other package failures. At this point the cargo tank lost approximately 300 gallons, ER personnel would not allow us to stop the leak until there the tank was anchored by a recovery unit. We requested a tow truck to anchor it around 5:30 on Wed 9-13-2023, but one was never called. At approximately 7:00 PM, the incident commander decided to put off all efforts on hold until 7:30/8:00 AM the following morning due to location and darkness setting in. Due to no cell phone coverage in the area, we had requested ER personnel made all required ^ notifications to EPA, CaIOES, NRC, etc. California Highway Patrol was IC, Alameda Fire was on site, Ambulance, Fish and Wildlife, local environmental agency, the Sf Water district, etc were all onsite. At 07:30 on 9-14-23, a recovery 65 ton rotator arrived on site to secure the trailer. At approximately 8:30 we were allowed to do damage assessment on the trailer and found the source of the leak, drove a redwood plug onto it and stopped the leak. We then hooked up a 2 inch hose between the discharge line and a 70 barrel vacuum tank. By this time, since plugging was delayed, the cargo tank lost approximately 2,000 gallons of product. Tank was emptied, recovered and uprighted.",Better delivery instructions for these rural deliveries. Better signage for the delivery point and mandate that if the driver gets lost to stop and call dispatch for directions.

The driver noticed that there was some liquid on the front of the trailer along with oily stains on the back of the trailer. Veolia personnel started to remove the drums from the trailer and identified the leaking drum which was located at the nose of the trailer. The leaking drum was a 55 gal metal drum with a pin hole leak that appeared to occur from potentially rubbing/impact against another drum during transportation which was a weak spot due to corrosion. The driver made multiple stops that day and he has stated that he did not notice any staining on the back-end of the trailer when he loaded addition drums at each stop. Also he did not notice any oily material near or around the front of the trailer during those stops. We are unsure of the duration of the spill but based on the quantity still left in the drum, roughly 5 gallons had leaked out. The drum was placed into a salvage drum and the spill clean up was completed by the Veolia in-house crew.  Most of the material was contained inside the trailer with minimal amounts outside of the trailer.  There was no evidence of a any spill on the ground itself.","Based on the investigation, the drums are stored outdoors at the customer site which contributed to some corrosion and likely caused some weak spots on the drum. The driver stated that there was some surface rust on the drum but nothing that may have compromised the drum itself.

The car was isolated and the shipper, National Response Center, and West Virginia DEP were notified.  (CHEMTREC Report #2023-0913-00015). Quick Response, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the fill hole cover closed however gasketing material was displaced and preventing a proper seal resulting in a vapor release of lading. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper, Mr. Rob Cline of Tetra Technologies, phone 304-482-7655. Contractor personnel properly installed the gasket and fill port cover without incident thus securing the release. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport.

Additionally,  during routine switching operations a Conrail Conductor was splashed with acid from the improperly secured tank car. The Conductor was immediately brought in to remove affected clothing and shower of any impacted skin. No reportable injury was encountered as the Conductors and Terminal Supervisions actions removed all material before any health effects took place. The car was isolated and the shipper/consignee PVS was notified directly via phone. Enviroserve, an approved Conrail Contractor was notified to respond, inspect and secure the tank car. Enviroserve personnel, investigated the leak and found the source of the leak to be from the rupture disk assembly. Upon further inspection it was found that the inspection cap was hanging off the housing and no rupture disk was in place beneath the assembly. Additionally, there was no required surge protection on the rupture disk assembly. Enviroserve placed the appropriate rupture disk and resecured the assembly. The tank car was then held until the proper surge protection device could be placed in the assembly. Conrail and Enviroserve worked with the car owner and Steve Kuz, Alltrantec 519-718-8377 to secure the proper service equipment.  On October 4, 2023 the new surge protection device was installed on the tank car and it was released back into transportation.

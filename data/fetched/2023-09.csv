ERTS dispatched contractors to conduct cleanup operations. Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 150-gallons of material released to two areas of the concrete dock floor each measuring 20’ x 20’. The release was caused due to a forklift puncture. The remaining material in the tote was transferred into a new tote. Water was deployed to neutralize the impacted areas and absorbents were then used to collect all material. The damaged tote was cut up and containerized along with all cleanup debris into (9) 55-gallon poly drums.

(Alkyl (C12-C14 Dimethylamine) UN2735 8, II) from a tanker.  Contractors were dispatched to clean up the release.  Upon arrival, contractors confirmed that the release was caused by loose flange bolts on the tanker and was contained to a 50' x 2' area of asphalt, and a 1' x 1' area of nearby soil. Contractors were able to clean up the release with absorbents, pad, and the proper PPE. They used hand tools to scrap the affected soil, and tightened the flange bolts, so the cargo could be forwarded on to the original consignee.  All waste generated was containerized in (2) 55-gallon poly drums which was then taken offsite by contractors for proper disposal.

At the time of the report, no drains or waterways were reported to have been impacted. ERTS dispatched AMPOL (environmental contractor) for response and remedial operations. AMPOL personnel arrived on site and advised that site personnel already transferred the remaining product into a new IBC. AMPOL personnel reported that approximately 50 gallons released to a 30ft x 30ft area on concrete and a 30ft x 5ft area of adjacent grass. Site personnel and first responders contained the release with granular absorbents. AMPOL personnel applied soda ash to the impacted area of concrete and collected the wastes for pending disposal.

The pallet chosen was not sturdy enough to fully support the bag, and there were large spaces between the slats on the pallet. The weight of the bag crushed down parts of the pallet, and caused sections of the bag to sag into the void space between the pallet slats, down into the space used to move the pallet. When the forklift was used to lift the pallet, the forks punctured the bag, causing the release. The pallet and bag were placed into a temporary containment and an inhouse response team was called in to repackage the contents into drums.","We have provided examples of sturdier pallets that have minimal to no spacing between the wooden slats, as well as plastic pallets that have no spacing to the customer for use with these bags.

The driver had just loaded up at the company's Seguin, TX location, and was making the trip back to his home terminal in Georgetown, TX.  The driver had not yet scaled the load, but we estimate that it was around 46-47,000 of ammonium nitrate as cargo.  The driver was familiar with the road and intersection.  He was driving a truck that he was familiar with.  The trailer was a different one than he usually used, this one being slightly heavier.    The driver was negotiating a left hand turn on route 1979 (intersection with 621).  Based on telematics data the rig was taking the turn around 20 MPH.  Partway into the turn, the vehicle started to tip over.  The driver tried to right the rig, but it overturned onto its passenger side, somewhat perpendicular to the road it had just turned onto, with part of it on the pavement and part on the grass.  The latches on one of the dome lids opened due to the impact, and roughly 2 pounds of ammonium nitrate fell out onto the grass.  The weather was clear and dry, and the area was free of water, so the product was contained in the roughly 2X3 area onto which it spilled.  The driver was unhurt.  He got out of the vehicle and began his emergency response procedures, which include contacting 911, Chemtrec, and company officials.  First responders showed up directly afterwards, along with Austin Powder Company officials.  Both roads in the intersection were closed at this point.  A spill contractor was dispatched out to the scene in anticipation of more product leaking from the package.  Wreckers were dispatched, and after a period of several hours, the truck and trailer were put upright.  There was nothing for the spill contractor to clean up, and the roads were opened completely after a period of roughly 5 hours. The small amount of product (2 pounds) was given to the Austin Powder Company officials to take back to their facility.","We can definitively say that this event was caused by speeding.  The driver simply took the turn too fast.  He was familiar with the intersection but simply misjudged how much needed to drop his speed.  ECMs on Austin trucks are governed by vehicle type (at a top speed).  We also utilize our telematics equipment to monitor ECM speed vs. posted speed limit.     Our corporate procedures call for counseling of drivers who are found to be chronic speeders. The driver in this incident is terminated at this point.  Our other drivers at these 2 area locations have been made aware of the accident, and the intersection in question.  It will be an area of focus that the trailer was one that he was not accustomed to pulling.  The additional weight of the trailer may have contributed toward his misjudgment of the speed he needed to maintain.  The event will be used as a training opportunity throughout our US operations.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,24050,AUSTIN POWDER COMPANY,US,

Slick Response was notified and responded with PTRA officers to the yard and were unable to find any indications of a release at 1500 hours. Several hours later at 1955 hours crews again reported an odor. Slick Response returned to the yard with PTRA managers and after walking several tracks responders found TILX 101045 releasing vapors from the PRD at approximately 2109 hours. The car, loaded sulfuric acid, spent, UN1832, was shipped from the Deer Park Refining LP (PEMEX) facility in Deer Park, TX. Plant personnel were notified of the vapor release from the PRD and they suggested we get the car to destination, Eco Services, approximately 2/10 of a mile from the site of the incident or we get water flowing through the coils of the car to cool the product. They also dispatched their own ER crew from SRS. PEMEX personnel suggested that the product may have a contaminant that was causing an exothermic reaction and building pressure in the tank. PTRA contacted the consignee, Eco Services, to see if they would accept the car in the current condition. They initially indicated that they would accept the car so arrangements were made to deliver the car to their facility. PTRA crews and managers moved the car to the north end of the yard across the street from Eco and requested that the gates be opened for delivery of the car. At that time the plant manager indicated that they would not be able to accept the car. Upon that notification the PTRA moved the car to a stub track adjacent to a water line where Slick Response and SRS Environmental personnel were able to connect the water line to the inlet for the coils. At that time the decision was made to shut down the yard and have all crews shelter in place at the main office building to the north of the yard until the car could be stabilized. Responders began flowing water through the coils at 0045 hours, they also vented some pressure to atmosphere to drop the pressure in the car. At that time a gauge was applied and showed an initial reading of 50 psi but it steadily began rising to 65 psi within a few minutes. With no way to control the rising pressure the decision was made to move the car approximately 7 miles to PEMEX, Deer Park Refining (the shipper) for offloading. Notifications were made to the NRC and voicemails left with FRA hazmat notifying them of the decision to move the car to PEMEX Deer Park. PTRA crews and mangers were briefed on the move, the car was secured, water lines removed and all lines closed and plugged for movement. A special train move was made to PEMEX Deer Park at 0415, the car was handed off to PEMEX Deer Park at 0510 hours.  The shelter in place at PTRA Manchester yard was lifted at 0415.

One out of three bottles leaked enough liquid into the outer box to wet the box and leak onto other packages below it. The Outer box is wet on the same end as the bottle that leaked.

One of the forks of the lift contacted the bottom valve of the transformer below the fins and broke the valve releasing residual PCB liquids that had collected in the bottom of the transformer after draining. Approximately 1 quart of the PCB oil was released on the asphalt surface. The RQ for PCBs (1 pound) was not met. The PCB content of the transformer was listed as 210 ppm of 1260 PCB. We collected approximately 4 gallons of residual oil from the broken valve. The transformer was received as PCB Drained 50 -499 ppm.   Speedy-dry applied to the spill area to absorb any free liquid, followed by double wash with kerosene and a final wash with de-greasing detergent.    Initially three 100 cm2 wipe samples were collected from the spill area. The spill was contained, the area cleaned, and samples collected by 13:04 MST. Spill duration was approximately 5 hours. An additional 3 samples of asphalt from the spill area were also collected the following day at the request of the EPA.",Verification that all drained transformers are drained and do not contain residual liquids.

Driver hooked up and started his delivery procedure. After cooling down the pump driver had tank pressure at 30 psi and delivered ~20 gallons. Driver heard a loud pop and thought a safety lifted. The driver shut down the delivery and secured all valves. The back cabinet tray was full of LOX and there was a large amount of vapor coming from cabinet. This made seeing anything inside very difficult. At this point the driver called his supervisor to talk through the issue. Supervisor and Mechanics looked at similar trailer at site for reference and talked through possible issues. Driver tried venting trailer and got pressure down to 15 psi but then the pressure would just build back up. With everything still secured there was still a leak happening in back of the trailer. All parties came to the conclusion it might be the inlet to the Fire Control Valve from the vessel. At this point a plan was developed to bring an empty trailer to the customer and offload 515303 into empty trailer. Second driver with new unit and Vehicle Recovery Team went to the customer. The team offloaded as much product as possible onto new unit. 515303 was then vented more and drained as much as possible to make it safe to transport. As the trailer was being offloaded, the back cabinet cleared out some the leak became visible. It was noted that the PB coil inlet flange from vessel was leaking LOX. ¿",Physical inspection of vessel before closure.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,"AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC.",US,

ERTS dispatched Hepaco to conduct cleanup and containment of the material. At 1902 ET, Hepaco personnel arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 75 gallons of ""Microtox Prime"" released from the tote to a 40' x 40' area of the dock floor due to a puncture in the tote. A containment area was set up around the release to prevent migration. Crew began applying absorbent material to the impacted dock area. The tote was elevated and patched to slow the release. The released product was being captured inside a 55 gallon poly drum. Crew collected all free standing liquid from the dock floor and then applied more absorbents. Once the new tote was delivered the product was transferred from the damaged tote and into a new one. Wood pallet debris was removed from all waste to prevent any reaction. This material was collected into a poly bag along with absorbent material. All impacted absorbent material and the damaged cut up tote were then collected and containerized into (6) 55 gallon poly drums. Hepaco advised the bung caps were left open to relieve any pressure build up.  On June 21, 2022, at 1208 ET, Hepaco returned to evaluate the drums and advised the thermal temperature on 5 of the drums were sitting at 87-88 degrees with the floor temperature of the XPO terminal warehouse reading 82-85 degrees. However, one drum was still at 100.8 degrees so the bung was not tighten down yet. Hepaco's game plan was to give this drum another 24 hours to continue to cool down and will return for inspection. On June 22, 2022, Hepaco returned at 1808 ET and advised all drums were now sitting at 96-97 degrees and are sealed up.

HEPACO, LLC, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found spilled lading on the top and sides of the tank car, 8 of 8 manway cover securement bolts less than tool tight and a displaced manway nozzle gasket in poor condition and displaced resulting in the release of lading. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper, Nicole Hameister of Canal Terminal Company, phone 708-516-1043. Contractor personnel installed a compatible manway gasket, secured all manway cover securement bolts in accordance with 49 CFR 173.31, and cleaned all spilled material. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move. 7.1 is not required.

The incident truck was moved to Penske waiting for disposition. No injuries to the driver.",East Penn does not believe our driver could have done anything differently to avoid this situation.

The local Fire Dept. in Warren spread dirt and sand on the areas that were affected.  T & R Environmental out of Bath, NY responded and remediated the contaminated areas long the driver's route.

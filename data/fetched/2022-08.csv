CDT, Clean Harbors was contacted by Union Pacific Rail personnel to advise that we had a rail car that was leaking an unknown Hazardous Material. Union Pacific Rail personnel contacted United Professional Services (UPS) to respond and clean/remediate the rail tank car. UPS personnel determined that the material was being released from the manway of the rail car and was Raw Gas Oil. The cause of the release was a faulty gasket between the chime of the manway and the lid. UPS personnel replaced the gasket and secured the manway. UPS personnel advised that the manway was properly closed/torqued when they opened the manway to determine the cause of the release. They determined by use of a strapping chart that the total amount released was approx. 5 gal. The remediation efforts generated a 5 gallon bucket of soiled absorbent pads and microbial solution to clean the side of the rail car. This waste material will be manifested and shipped to a final disposal location by United Professional Services. No product was released to the ground.","Clean Harbors Environment Services Inc. will provide remedial training to the affected personnel at the generating / offering facility regarding thorough inspection of the gasket material between the manway chime and the lid of the tank car prior to properly closing the manway per the tank car manufacturer's specific closure instructions. This inspection will be conducted to identify any possible defects in the gasket material that may allow the release of material from the rail car while in transit. If defects are identified, the gasket will be replaced immediately before the tank car is offered for transport.",No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"SAFETY-KLEEN SYSTEMS, INC.",US,

The car was isolated and BASF, IDEM, and NRC were notified.  CHEMTREC Report # 2022-0818-00366. Hepaco, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found product leaking from the liquid line under the unsecure less then tool tight secondary plug, additionally 4 of 4 blind flange bolts securing the liquid valve to the pressure plate were found less then tool tight. The liquid line valve handle was in the closed position. Hepaco also found a securement pin on a second protective housing broke. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Michael Doring, 225-339-2585, michael.doring@basf.com. Contractor personnel secured the secondary plug, tightened four liquid line flange bolts, secured the protective housing pin on the secondary compartment, and remediated the free standing liquid. The leak was secured a filtered air blanket was placed on the tank and the car was released for transport. This incident did require a special switching move and will require a 7.1 report.   Cause Code: 118 NARRI: 5",(NAR CODE: 242 5 What Failed: Liquid Line / Liquid Valve Where Failed: Connection between liquid line and closure (blind) flange Why Failed: Closure (blind) flange bolts/nuts - less than tool tight)  Proper loading procedures and inspections prior to releasing cars into transportation were communicated with the shipper.  Pertaining to this particular car I have recommended that the certificate of construction be reviewed to ascertain if a secondary protective housing is warranted as there were no valves or fittings under the protective housing which mislead first responders to think the car was a multiple compartment car.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,10250,"CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC.",US,

Upon inspection, I found that the HazMat was inside a plastic container that had a lid that appeared secure. The lid was also taped, with plastic tape, to the container. However, upon tilting the plastic container, I found it to leak from underneath the lid, near the left handle. Approximately, 3 ounces had leaked from the plastic container onto the package bottom. No damage was observed on the plastic container or the outer package.  The package had the upright arrows, but it had to be turned upside down at some point for it to leak. Pictures were taken and all required reports will be filled. DescribePack: The package was leaking from underneath the lid, near the left handle.

The driver thought that he was in the lane that continued straight, not the lane that turned into an exit ramp. The driver could not slow down fast enough to make the turn. He locked up the brakes and the truck and trailer rolled on its side. About 4-5 gallons of product leaked from the dome lid as the trailer was on its side. About 2 more gallons leaked while emergency responders were in the process of getting the product pumped out of the trailer and into another trailer. Emergency responders drilled holes in the side of the trailer to pump out the product into a backup trailer. Product was contained to about a 5 ft by 5 ft area that was remediated. Excavators were on site to clean up any contaminated soil.",Equipment was in proper condition. Accident occurred due to driver error.

The trailer contained a pallet of containers stretched wrapped together on a pallet. The employee proceeded to remove this pallet with a forklift and while he was attempting to the lift the pallet the forks of the forklift punctured the container. This action resulted in a release of the contents of a single 3 gallon poly closed top container. The forklift operator immediately noticed the release and proceeded to clean up the spill along with other hazmat trained Veolia employees. All spilled material was absorbed with absorbent pads and powder and was repacked into a new 5 gallon container.   The cause of the spill was due to broken planks on the pallet which allowed the bottoms of the 3 gallon poly containers to sag below the top deckboard. When the forklift operator placed his forks inside the opening and lifted the pallet, the container got punctured. The entire duration of the spill was less than 1 minute due to the container size.","Veolia will retrain its employees to examine wooden pallets prior to off-loading to keep an eye out for any signs of broken or compromised pallets, such as containers that are not uniform or leaning which could be an indicator of potential broken deckboards.",No,,,,No,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The spill consisted of 1 or more 773 pound steel cylinders of argon refrigerated liquid, which was discovered by a dock worker as they heard a ""hissing"" sound coming from the trailer. ERTS dispatched Hepaco to conduct a site assessment and cleanup. At 1042 ET, Hepaco personnel arrived onsite. Hepaco observed a cylinder of Argon that had been overfilled or became overpressurized due to ambient temperature change. Once the unit reached 350 PSI, the safety relief valve allows the Argon to escape and reduce pressure in the vessel. However, the relief unit is spring operated and once the unit froze, the valve was stuck in the open position. ERTS contacted the shipper and they confirmed this was a common occurrence and advised that if necessary, leave the unit outside and open the vent line and release the material. Hepaco ultimately applied warm water to the ice that had formed which allowed the relief valve to close and stop releasing. ERTS asked Hepaco to check the pressure on the other two cylinders of Argon in this shipment. Hepaco reported that they were close to 350 PSI and agreed to release some of the pressure so all three units could ship on without further incident.

GSS was able to indicate that 2 gallons of UN3264, Corrosive Liquids, Acidic, Inorganic, N.O.S (Sulphuric Acid/Copper Sulphate) had leaked from one 55-gallon DF. One 55-gallon poly drum was damaged and was already overpacked into a 95-gallon poly drum. Terminal personnel also generated a 55-gallon metal drum of absorbents, GSS overpacked the metal drum into a 95-gallon poly drum. 2 gallons of product spilled in total under the trailer in a 1ft by 3ft area as well as a 4ft by 4ft area. GSS unloaded and confirmed no other drums were damaged but two pallets were impacted.  A soda ash solution was used to neutralize the impacted areas.

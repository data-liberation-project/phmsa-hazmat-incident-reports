Additionally a customer rep unlocked the fill line for him further bypassing protocols and they knew there was too much product for the tank to hold and that it would be a partial unload.  The rep was going to tell him when to shut down.  Ultimately that communication didn't happen and 3-4 gallons overflowed the tank down the sides and into the containment area.

Upon the contractor’s arrival, personnel observed that the released material impacted a 56ft-by-6ft area of the trailer floor and the dock floor and estimated that seventy-five (75) gallons of material was released due to a forklift puncturing one (1) 55-gallon metal drum of Hi-Temp 1200 causing it to knock over into one (1) 55-gallon poly drum of PBTCA damaging it. Before Clean Harbors’ arrival, Dayton Freight personnel had placed both damaged drums into two (2) 85-gallon overpacks. Clean Harbors personnel deployed the neutralizer sodium bicarbonate and granular absorbents to the impacted area. They used a pH strip to test the paint inside the metal drum which resulted in a neutral result. All impacted absorbents were placed into one (1) 55-gallon poly drum. The waste was staged onsite at the terminal prior to contractor demobilization. After departing off site, Clean Harbors personnel were asked to return to assist with the transfer of the contents of one (1) 85-gallon metal overpack drum to a one (1) 85-gallon poly drum due to the corrosive nature of the contained material. One (1) 85-gallon ploy drum was used to contain neutralizers and granular absorbents utilized during the transfer. Clean Harbors personnel staged one (1) 55-gallon poly drum, one (1) 85-gallon metal drum, and three (3) 85-gallon poly drums onsite at the terminal prior to the contractor demobilization.

The Occidental Chemical driver was loaded at an IMTT facility located in Geismar, LA. While the unloading process was underway, it was discovered that the bleeder valve on the product transfer line that goes to the product storage tank was left open. This resulted in approximately 2,500 gallons of Hydrochloric acid being released from the product line into the containment area. No injuries or exposure to chemical occurred as a result of this event, as well as no off-site impact or environmental impact. The offloading process was halted, bleeder valve closed, containment area drained to sump for processing, and remainder of offload was completed.","The OxyChem truck driver immediately shut down the offloading operation upon discovery. The area was drained to a treatment sump, washed down and cleaned up.

The employee notified the Waterloo Yard Master who in turn notified the CN Dangerous Goods Team. The tank car was set out to an isolation track (WA90) for inspection by a CN emergency response contractor. A CN emergency response contractor was dispatched to the location for mitigation. The contractor performed an inspection of the tank car and found the bottom outlet valve to be leaking from the threads of the bottom outlet valve cap. (The BOV cap was found to be less than tool tight and the BOV handle was disengaged and pinned upon initial inspection). Also, the car seal provision indicator was not properly engaged according to the BOV diagram provided on the car. Cap was tightened and the BOV valve was inspected. The BOV valve handle was cycled exposing the valve was in the open position. The BOV cap was then removed and observed for 20 minutes to ensure there was no further leakage from the valve. The BOV cap gasket was replaced. The bottom outlet valve cap was then re-installed and tightened with a 36"" pipe wrench. Upon tightening the BOV cap, CN emergency response contractor proceeded to place new cable seals on the BOV / Cap.

The Veolia employees were in the process of loading totes onto a box truck using an electric pallet jack. The Veolia box truck was positioned at the customer's loading dock.  During the loading procedure, an incident occurred when a tote situated near the front of the box truck (one of the first to be loaded) was accidentally punctured. This happened as the pallet jack operator was attempting to place a second tote behind it, towards the rear/open end of the truck.  The puncture occurred in the left-hand lower quadrant of the 275-gallon tote. As a result, the contents began to leak, flowing from the front of the box truck towards the rear while it was still in the loading dock. The leaking material spilled off the truck and into the customer's secondary containment system, where it was successfully contained.  The customer's team promptly responded to the situation by transferring the remaining contents of the damaged tote into a new, undamaged container. They also managed to recover the spilled material from the secondary containment area. It is estimated that less than 250 gallons of the material was lost to the customer's containment system.","1. Veolia employees will be retrained on the use of the electric pallet jack.  2. The Veolia employee operating the pallet jack will be retrained with focus on hazard analysis in the operation of loading chemicals into box trucks.

The entire trailer floor, a 150’ x 30’ area of the concrete lot below, and 4 drains and 1 catch basin were impacted. All drains lead to the catch basin where the material was contained. The crew utilized a vac truck to remove the product from the catch basin and drains leading to it. Absorbents were deployed to the trailer and concrete lot and worked in. Once the drains were done, absorbent boom was placed in them to collect any residual material. The product remaining the damaged tote was pumped out and the damaged tote was cut up and containerized. Crew returned to site and inspected the drains and flushed and vacuumed them out again. Additional wastewater was generated to be offloaded into totes. Samples were collected to confirm that no residual material remains in the catch basin and samples were collected from the nearby retention pond as well as a precaution. All wastewater was offloaded into totes and all solid cleanup debris was containerized into 55-gallon poly drums.

Driver said the FXO employee explained strange situation that occurred with the customer dropping it off. The customer allegedly tried to offer it with Class 9 diamonds on it, but the FXO employee refused to accept, so the customer left and came back later with the Class 9 diamonds removed. FXO employee accepted it at that time but told driver about this. Driver told QA. The DG Nav specialist opened it for inspection and found that it contains a solar generator classified as UN3480. While there is a small UN3480 printed on the box, the customer seems to have deliberately removed the Class 9 diamonds to render it undeclared. Customer's return address is a business in Florida, but the last name connected to his first name in FAST when searching the business address appears fake. The phone number listed on the Fedex label is fake.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Federal Express Corporation,US,

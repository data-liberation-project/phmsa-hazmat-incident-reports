Six(6) drums were loaded on one wooden skid(pallet) and were secured with plastic and metal banding and shrink-wrap. There were damaged boards on the loading side of the skid. The drum that was Ieaking had its chime fall between the boards, either during the banding process or during transportation. The constant friction of transportation caused the chime area to buckle into the bottom of the drum. The drums are not UN Specification as required in the regulations. We contacted our emergency spill clean-up vendor. They placed the 7 gallon drum into a larger overpack containment drum. The materials used to clean up the small amount that spilled were placed into a 5-gallon plastic bucket for waste disposal. Please see the accompanying photographs of the load upon arrival and the subsequent mitigation. While we do no have the final figures on the remediation, we believe the cost of the clean-up crew to average around $500 or more, and the disposal of the clean-up material to start at$250.","Use of proper packaging by the shipper, and the loader securing the drums onto a pallet with a smooth wooden top would have greatly reduced the risk of drum failure during transportation.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,ZZ,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,750,FEDEX LOGISTICS,US,

A railroad  qualified response contractor was mobilized to investigate. Upon arrival, responders identified that the release was emanating from the threads on the nipple,  where the liquid valve connects to the pressure plate. Responders could not tighten the valve  because the threads were cross threaded. Because of this, absorbents were placed in the protective  housing, around the leak to catch additional product and replaced daily. The shipper was notified,  and subsequently mobilized a Mobile Repair Unit (MRU) to repair the car. The MRU removed the  Nitrogen pad (5Ibs) that had been applied to the car at the time of shipping, which stopped the  leak. However, the MRU could not remove the liquid valve to repair the connection. Because of this, the Shipper applied for an OTMA to move the car to home shop. Both CPKC and UP  Railroads would not agree to this move, so the car was transferred and cleaned an purged in St.  Paul. Once this was done, CPKC and UP Railroads agreed to move the car under an OTMA-1 to home shop  for repairs. File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated based on the best information available at  the time of filing. This shipment was offered as a 'bulk' shipment, aka one car load, therefore the  exact amount offered in this package is not known to the carrier. This carrier does not have access to mass balance data which can exactly quantify this value.","The 500 LINE RAILROAD COMPANY (DBA CPKC) notified shipper of this release. Continued emphasis with  Offerors/Shippers is made encouraging them to conduct thorough inspections prior to movement in  order to reduce equipment failures in the field. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating  on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail  yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and  both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non  accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct  a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective  action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with CPKC.  (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Ed Dankbar, 500 Line Railroad, 120 S 6th ST STE 900, Minneapolis, MN 55402.

When the truck was opened there was liquid already spilled and shutters were closed immediately. We immediately cordoned off the area and called PAPD to report the DG spill.  PAPD Officer Farber (Badge#1829) responded at 2220 to investigate. PAPD ESU & Port Auth Ops arrived shortly after.  Hassan simultaneously contacted the 24HR emergency contact on DGD (Celinia @ NCEC) and was advised safety precautions, spill response and containment methods.  This was relayed to Port Ops and PAPD ESU.  PAPD started containment process with speedy dry at 2235 and completed at 2320. 7 of 36 Jerricans (AWB 020-69236160) were affected and stored in containment drums in the DG reject area. AWB: 020-43064475 was loaded next to leaking jerricans and was also wet/stored in containment drum. We also noticed that liquid had leaked from trailer to tire and ground.  Speedy dry was used to contain the leak. Safety-Kleen was contacted at 2323 for cleanup of contained spill and disposal.  Safety-Kleen dispatched a response team at 0105   Trailer is currently in Bay 52. Driver is onsite waiting on cleanup to leave.

Crews then utilized a rotary transfer pump to transfer the contents of the damaged 275-gallon tote to a new 275-gallon tote to be shipped off to its destination. MER personnel deployed granular absorbents inside the damaged tote, to solidify any remaining product, once the rotary transfer pump stopped. Crews then placed absorbent pads, under the damaged tote, and wrapped the tote in two (2) layers of poly sheeting to ensure any additional residual product was contained.

The driver met with the customer site operator, completed the “In the Interest of Safety Form” (which is a form utilized by Basic Chemical truck drivers to ensure that enough space exists in a customer tank prior to unloading), hooked up offloading hoses, and began offloading. Near the end of offloading, the driver knew the tanker trailer was getting close to being empty, so he got with the customer site operator to check the level of the storage tank again to ensure there was enough room remaining in the product storage tank. The operator checked the level of the storage tank and confirmed with the driver that there was enough space to complete the offload. Not long after the customer site operator left the area the storage tank began to overflow and the Basic Chemicals truck driver immediately shut down the flow of product. The driver got with the customer site operator to notify him of the overflow and the operator stated that the tank level indicator had been malfunctioning lately. Customer site personnel were able to clean up the spill which was estimated to be approximately 20 gallons. No injuries or damage to equipment was reported.",The Basic Chemicals truck driver immediately shut down the offloading operation and notified customer site operators. The area was washed down and cleaned up. Occidental Chemical Tech Service group has been requested to reach out to the customer site (Mosaic) to discuss necessary corrections that are needed moving forward to prevent a re-occurrence.

The faulty gasket allowed for mineral oil to leak out of the drum. The mineral oil was used to coat the reactive lithium in the drum. No actual lithium was released from the drum.  The 551A2 lid was opened and the gasket of the drum was inspected and found to be defective and had allowed mineral oil to seep out. The gasket on the drum was replaced and the entire drum was overpacked into an 85 gallon 1A2 salvage drum. Transportation to the ultimate disposal facility was continued.","On 11/08/2023, the Veolia safety manager was notified of the spill.

The container of sulfonic acid shifted and fell on its side during transportation resulting in a release of material which mixed with the hydrochloric acid causing a reaction and vapor release.

The spray had gotten on the passenger vehicle. The local county Sherriff reported to the scene. The liquid that was released was evaporating very quickly and no residue was collecting on the ground. We had a response team show up to the scene they were able to bring a new cap for the cleanout and the driver was on his way. The driver of the personal vehicle later reported that her and her child was exposed to the material because there window was down when they were behind our vehicle and that they went to there physician and was told to go to the ER.

The unit left the roadway resulting in a release to the shoulder soil. On November 16, 2023, at 0935 ET, XPO Logistics retained ERTS to manage and oversee the incident. ERTS dispatched ES&H to the site to perform all cleanup and remediation activities. On November 16, 2023, at 1230 ET, ES&H personnel arrived on site and began assisting the onsite wrecker company, Lewis Wrecker Service, with clearing the wreckage debris. The wrecker company hauled the two damaged trailers offsite after conducting a soil/debris scrape to remove as much material and debris from the ground. ES&H personnel were able to confirm approximately 25-gallon of diesel released from a damaged saddle tank along with approximately 100-gallons of UN1210 STR Steam Mat from (2) 55-gallon metal drums, and approximately 1- quart of UN3077 Cyasorb THT 7001 EF Light Stabilizer (PGIII) from a single 50-pound poly bag. The impacted soil area was confirmed to measure approximately 20’ x 30’. The contractors confirmed the majority of the cargo released to the inner trailer and freight. A roll off was utilized to containerize (20) 55-gallon metal drums of STR Steam Mat that were not releasing, along with two empty drums of this product. A total of (60) 50-pound bags of Cyasorb were individually poly wrapped and placed in the roll off. A total of (6) 5-gallon poly jugs of non-regulated PureOil Formulation K were placed into the roll off. One 55-gallon poly drum of debris, impacted grass, and soil was also generated and staged in the roll off. The roll off was then hauled to the wrecker yard. On November 17, 2023, ES&H personnel returned to the site to assess the area and complete final cleanup. ES&H located a small indent in the ground measuring 4' x 18"" that was still impacted by some free-standing liquid of UN1210 STR Steam Mat. ES&H solidified the material with acid gator and collected it into their poly waste bags. Acid gator was deployed near the tree as well. An additional 17 bags of impacted mud, dirt, leaves, and acid gator were generated and removed from site. The bags were hauled to the roll off and placed inside pending overpacking. On November 20, 2023, ES&H personnel returned to the wrecker yard for waste containerizing. The (20) 55-gallon drums of UN1210 STR Steam Mat were wiped down and shrink wrapped 4 to a pallet for salvage. The two empty drums of STR Steam Mat were crushed and containerized into a 55-gallon poly drum along with poly sheeting for disposal. All (60) 50-pound bags of UN3077 Cyasorb THT 7001 EF Light Stabilizer (PGIII) were containerized into 3 supersacks for disposal.

The Town of Hope Mills, NC had attempted an arrest that led to a chase where the assailant fled to 1-95. The police continued the chase on 1-95 into a construction zone, the assailant attempted to pass our vehicle on the right where he was blocked with concrete barricades, and wedged his vehicle between our truck and the concrete barricades, causing him and our driver to crash. Our vehicle hit the concrete barricade on the right and the tank rolled over the concrete median, which gouged a small hole in two places on the tank, causing approx 1,500 gallons to spill on the roadway and soil adjacent to the road. The Fayetteville, NC hazmat team secured the area, plugged the holes, and controlled the pump out of the cargo tank, and allowed us to place absorbent booms to control the migration of the gasoline.  No photos are available for the pump out and original damage due to the HazMat team keeping everyone away from the tanker until it was pumped out. The product was leaking approximately 7-8 hours until  they could get the holes stopped up. We have hired a geologist to assist with supervising the follow up cleanup and removal of contaminated soil. That work has not begun at the time of this report.",This accident should not have happened. We do not know of any way to have improved our driver's performance in handling this situation.

When the driver began to offload product they immediately noticed the cam-lock connection at the customers connection was dripping, so they shut down the process, cleared the line and shimmed the cam-lock ears. The driver resumed unloading a second time and noticed the fitting continued to drip so they closed the internal valve on top of the tanker trailer and replaced the gasket at the cam-lock connection. When the driver reopened the internal valve, product was released from the CPVC piping system that is connected to the internal valve of the trailer. Approximately 2 cups of product was release and spilled. No injuries or damage to equipment was reported.",The driver waited for a 3rd party repair company to arrive at the customer site and make necessary repairs to the tanker trailer. The repair company arrived on-site and discovered a damaged CPVC fitting in the piping system that contributed to the minimum release of product. The repair company made the necessary repairs to the trailer and the driver was then able to safely offload the product into the customer storage tank.

Product freezes at 50-52 degrees • Initially when he opened the trailer and customer valves (internal and external) nothing was flowing.   • Stopped, shut compressor off, closed the airline and internal and external.  Bled the pressure off the line.  No pressure was on the line or product.  Used 50 foot airline and blew heat on the QRB to warm it up.  Gave up on that.  The customer had steam so they heated the valve.  Got product flowing.   • He had 2 hoses to make delivery.  He had a wall to his right side and the back of the truck.  As such the first hose had to loop around to get it under the trailer to the wall where there was a 6” hole where part of his second hose went through the wall and connected to the customer fill line 3-4 feet inside.  After the fill line hook up there is a shut off valve roughly 8” after that.  The fill line then goes vertical to the ceiling and then over and in to the tank.     • The product (Bevrosheen) was very slushy.  This was tied to compartment 3. • At the end of the offload he saw the hose rise up and could feel the hose was light.   • He shut down and then cracked his external open and walked the line to the customer tank and shut their fill line and the internal and external valves on the trailer.   • At this point he went to bleed the pressure off the hoses but the chicago cap for the bleeder valve was froze on.  He used a screw driver to break it free.  He then lifted his pale up to the bleeder valve and opened it  ¼ of the way and nothing came out.  He continued to open it more and nothing came out.  Both he and the unloader knew that it must be blocked with frozen product.  With the bleeder valve closed now he used a screw driver to get it clear of frozen product.  It then depressurized as expected when he opened the valve.  He commented that the amount of time it took to depressurize was consistent with how long it normally takes.  The process to get the bleeder valve clear from frozen product took roughly 3-5 minutes which is noteworthy as this was time the hoses with product inside were sitting idle in the cold weather • Richard was able to safely disconnect the hose (ie – any pressure in the hose in theory is clearly gone at this point) and reducer fitting from the trailer and then capped off the reducer fitting.  He kept the reducer fitting on that end of the hose attached as the unloader was going to take the reducer and two hoses and rinse them out together for our driver.  When the unloader got the one end of the hose with the reducer fitting on it near the wash station he laid it down and uncapped it again (again no pressure coming out of it).  Our driver now moved to the customer fill line and he loosened the camlock (right side) furthest away from him first and then the left side closest too him (following protocol) which is when the hose blew off of the fill line down towards the ground with a line of product shooting up at him.",We believe this was a weather related cause where product froze in the line trapping some pressure and not allowing it to be bled off.  Richard will receive additional training on wearing proper PPE going forward and strategies he can do use to help mitigate fogging issues.  He is expected to make a full recovery.,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,US,

When the driver began to offload product they immediately noticed the cam-lock connection at the customers connection was dripping, so they shut down the process, cleared the line and shimmed the cam-lock ears. The driver resumed unloading a second time and noticed the fitting continued to drip so they closed the internal valve on top of the tanker trailer and replaced the gasket at the cam-lock connection. When the driver reopened the internal valve, product was released from the CPVC piping system that is connected to the internal valve of the trailer. Approximately 2 cups of product was release and spilled. No injuries or damage to equipment was reported.",The driver waited for a 3rd party repair company to arrive at the customer site and make necessary repairs to the tanker trailer. The repair company arrived on-site and discovered a damaged CPVC fitting in the piping system that contributed to the minimum release of product. The repair company made the necessary repairs to the trailer and the driver was then able to safely offload the product into the customer storage tank.  This incident was reviewed with the driver by their supervisor so the driver fully understood the cause for the CPVC piping failure. Existing offloading procedures were discussed to ensure driver's understanding.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,OCCIDENTAL CHEMICAL CORPORATION,US,

The driver met with the customer site operator, completed the “In the Interest of Safety Form” (which is a form utilized by Basic Chemical truck drivers to ensure that enough space exists in a customer tank prior to unloading), hooked up offloading hoses, and began offloading. Near the end of offloading, the driver knew the tanker trailer was getting close to being empty, so he got with the customer site operator to check the level of the storage tank again to ensure there was enough room remaining in the product storage tank. The operator checked the level of the storage tank and confirmed with the driver that there was enough space to complete the offload. Not long after the customer site operator left the area the storage tank began to overflow and the Basic Chemicals truck driver immediately shut down the flow of product. The driver got with the customer site operator to notify him of the overflow and the operator stated that the tank level indicator had been malfunctioning lately. Customer site personnel were able to clean up the spill which was estimated to be approximately 20 gallons. No injuries or damage to equipment was reported.",The Basic Chemicals truck driver immediately shut down the offloading operation and notified customer site operators. The area was washed down and cleaned up. Occidental Chemical Tech Service group has been requested to reach out to the customer site (Mosaic) to discuss necessary corrections that are needed moving forward to prevent a re-occurrence.

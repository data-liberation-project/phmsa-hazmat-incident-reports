Crews deployed granular absorbents to the impacted trailer and swept them in with hand tools. The damaged tote was transferred into a new 330-gallon tote. The empty, damaged tote was removed for disposal. All spent absorbents and cleanup debris were collected and containerized into three (3) 55-gallon drums for transport and disposal.  On June 20, 2024, R+L requested crews return to the site to address lingering odors inside the trailer and excess dried product that remained on interior and exterior surfaces of the trailer.

The employee notified the Waterloo Yard Master who in turn notified the CN Dangerous Goods Team. The tank car was set out to an isolation track (WA90) for inspection by a CN emergency response contractor. A CN emergency response contractor was dispatched to the location for mitigation. The contractor performed an inspection of the tank car and found the bottom outlet valve to be leaking from the threads of the bottom outlet valve cap. It was determined that there was a failure in the sealing surface of the valve seat to include a defective gasket. (The BOV cap was found to be less than tool tight and the BOV in the closed position and pinned upon initial inspection). CN emergency response contractor did observe cable seal to be correctly in place. The BOV cap was removed, and it was observed to be leaking past the closed ball. The BOV valve handle was cycled several times to the open and closed position to free any debris that may have been trapped in the BOV sealing surface potentially causing the leak. The BOV cap was then removed and observed for 20 minutes to ensure there was no further leakage from the valve. It was noted that the BOV cap gasket was deformed and was replaced. The bottom outlet valve cap was then re-installed and tightened with a 36"" pipe wrench. Upon tightening the BOV cap, CN emergency response contractor proceeded to place new cable seals on the BOV / Cap.",No comments provided.,No,TANK CAR,,117R100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,18000,WC,US,

Spilled material was neutralized and cleaned with absorbent and placed into a recovery container as was the punctured drum.,This was sort of an abnormity situation - maybe the paperwork should not be attached to the freight with a binder clip and instead placed into a packing list envelope to help prevent these types of unintentional releases from occurring.,No,,,,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,A.

All the shipper security seals were found to be intact at the time of inspection.  The security seals were removed from the manway cover and the protective housing cover. The manway cover was opened to inspect the gasket which was found to be in good condition. The manway cover was closed, and all swing bolts were properly tightened. The valve securement plugs were inspected and found tool tight. As well the BOV cap was found secured tool tight and new security seals were applied to the manway as well as the combination housing.

The associate notified the foreman and pulled the van onto the concrete roadway to get it off the gravel. We assessed the area and then we took the van to the CSF to be offloaded to find the leaking container. About halfway in the trailer we found the drum with a dime size hole in it and the contents had all leaked onto the trailer floor except for approx. 15 gal. We finished unloading the van and we processed the load. We cleaned the trailer floor with floor dry. We also cleaned the TL and the drive. The material that leaked onto the drive stained the concrete. The Transfer Line spill on the gravel was approx. 1 gal. it was contained in a 3 foot radius pot hole so we added floor dry to absorb the material.  We took a before and after sample to the lab with the cin. (519142) we used on the drum that leaked. All effected areas have been cleaned. We generated 1 (1/4 Full) Tote. Tote is labeled with a Haz.

Unit was taken to the Hazmat Pit for safety. On the behalf of the shipper, approved contractor United Pumping was contacted and dispatched to complete inspection.  Interior inspection revealed 15 supersacks in 2 rows throughout the container. Source of the leak was determined to be one supersack filled with pool chlorine granules in the rear of the unit. The cause for the Leak was determined to be less than a pound of pool chlorine leaked from the top of the supersack, contributing to the material leak. The granules mixed with the condensation in the unit creating a liquid which leaked from the rear of the container. Total quantity of leaked liquid was approximately 16 ounces of product. During the inspection a bullboard was located at the rear of the load as securement.  Contractor United Pumping completed remediation of the unit and all affected areas. Spilled product was cleaned and disposed of.",Shipper should review incident to ensure that materials do not leak while in transportation.,No,IBC,"Plastic, coated, for solids",13H2,Yes,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3000,BNSF - BNSF Railway Company,US,

The emergency shut off was used in hopes of stopping the leak. This attempt did not work because the product was actually coming from the flange above the external valve. Proper PPE was donned and the pressure was released from the top of the trailer. This slowed the leak down enough for our shop supervisor to don the proper PPE and check all the bolts and nuts on the flange. We found two nuts were very loose. These nuts were tightened up and the leak was completely stop. After our immediate investigation was completed, we discover that the two nuts that were lose had two lock washers that had flattened out not allowing the nuts to stay tight.","valve is removed then new lock washers must be used on every bolt. As part of our PM system we added that all nuts and bolts must be checked to ensure the nuts are staying tight.

While performing switching operations. The on shift CN Transportation supervisor made all internal notifications to activate an emergency response to investigate the cause and perform a cleanup.  A CN emergency response contractor was dispatched to the location and found the manway swing bolts were or appeared to be over tightened and compromised the lid gasket, pinching it and preventing a proper seal of the gasket allowing the contents to leak out when the car moved. Both the liquid and vapor line valve securement plugs were installed properly tool tight. The BOV cap was found tool tight. All the shipper security seals were found to be intact at the time of inspection.  The security seals were removed from the manway cover and the protective housing cover on UTLX 212116. The manway lid was opened to inspect the lid gasket which was found to be pinched/crushed. The damaged manway lid gasket was removed and replaced with a compatible lid gasket, then the manway cover was closed, and all swing bolts were properly tightened. The valve securement plugs were inspected and found tool tight. As well the BOV cap was found secured tool tight and new security seals were applied to the manway as well as the combination housing. The exterior of the tank car was cleaned off utilizing a rags and absorbent pads.

Further investigation revealed that a drum in the trailer was leaking from a small pin sized puncture in the middle of its body.  Approximately one pint of the liquid chemical had leaked from the drum and released onto the trailer floor. The duration of the spill was less than 5 minutes. The employee removed the leaking drum from the trailer and placed it into a salvage drum with absorbent. The spill was cleaned up by two other Veolia employees that were on the premises.","After a thorough review of the incident, Veolia believes that the drum got damaged due to the forklift operator going too fast and while driving over the dock plate. The bumps from the uneven surface caused the drum to pivot and the drum to hit the support on the drum grabber. In addition, the employee failed to tilt the load back on the forklift to prevent the drums from rocking. Veolia has prohibited the employee from any further forklift operation until he has been trained and re-evaluated for safe operations. Lastly, a reminder training was provided to other employees at the Veolia, Fremont location to make sure they keep the loads low and tilted back along with monitoring their speed especially when going over transitions (uneven surfaces) which may cause the drums rock. The drum grabber has also been evaluated to check for any damage or failure in the equipment.",No,,,,No,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The employee notified his supervisor who in turn made notification to the CN Dangerous Goods Team that initiated a response. The on-duty CN Dangerous Goods Officer dispatched an emergency response contractor to the location to investigate. The responding contractor noted a strong odor upon arrival to the rail car's location. There were no visible liquid leaks observed. The inspection of the top fittings revealed the manway cover gasket protruding from the manway cover. A 4-gas meter with a PID sensor detected 16 PPM of VOC's at the sealing surface of the manway cover. The shipper security seal was found to be intact upon arrival. The manway cover security seal was removed, and the cover opened for the purpose of inspecting the gasket. The inspection revealed the gasket to be torn preventing a proper seal allowing the product vapors to escape. The gasket was replaced followed by the re-securement of the swing bolts.

The driver checked in with security, then positioned the tractor and trailer at the unloading sight and met with the customer representative to sign the BOL, as well as OxyChem's ""In the Interest of Safety"" form. At approximately 8:10 AM, the unloading hose was connected to the customers flange, the trailer internal product valve was opened, and the air inlet valve to the trailer was opened. As the driver was opening the external valve, Hydrochloric Acid began to leak around the threaded connection of a CPVC ball valve that is part of the trailer blow down piping system. The driver proceeded to the front of the trailer where he closed the air inlet valve, and then around the truck to the left front trailer fender where he activated the emergency shutoff valve. He then contacted the customer representative to make them aware of the leak. Approximately 10 gallons of product leaked into a containment area. No injuries, chemical exposure or environmental impact resulted from this leak.","The area was washed down with water and the driver was able to inspect the valve. The driver found the thread coupling to the ball valve was not tight which allowed product to escape. He reconnected the coupling, pressurized the line with air and checked for leaks with soapy water, then unloaded the trailer without any problems.  Continue to check this style of valve when the trailer is re-torqued after its third delivery following its DOT cargo tank inspection.  Communicate the issue to OxyChem mechanics to increase awareness when installing these types of valves.  Have OxyChem mechanics check these types of valves during routine preventive maintenance checks to ensure they are tight.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Basic Chemicals Company,US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, CF Industries Sales LLC, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report#2024-0604-00147). CSXT Hazmat personnel responded to the yard and observed dried product within the service equipment housing that had leaked from the VRV. The valve was not actively leaking at the time of response. The issue was identified as a defective Vacuum Relief Valve and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper’s representative, Roy Mathew, 224-804-7190, rmathew@cfindustries.com.

The fiberboard box, plastic bottle containing the coating solution, and the plastic bags were placed securely in a hazardous materials bag and then inside a salvage drum. There was no inner packing materials to lessen the pressure on the cap of the coating solution to prevent the lid from loosening.",It is my recommendation that a cardboard liner be used at the base of the cap when transporting this specific hazmat product to prevent spills in the future.,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Federal Express Corporation,US,

This can be verified from the spidr image of the original package when it was picked up. Reviewing the DPR of the package, the package was not flagged as a dangerous goods, when in fact, 3 items of 2 different limited quantity was found. The original contents were 2 qty of 1 gallon metal container of Clear Guard EF, 1 metal can of Solvent Thinner, 1 qty 8 oz plastic container of Copper C Metal Coating, 1 qty of 8 oz Gold C Metal Coating, and 20fl oz high volume low pressure gravity feed spray gun. All items are products of Sculpt Nouveau. 1 container of Clear Guard EF was dented and the plastic seal for the lid came off and spill 3/4 of its contents. The Solvent Thinner was also dented and spilled from the cap around half of its content. The other gallon of Clear Guard EF was wet but salvageable, so are the metal coating, the content of the spray gun can be salvaged but the packaging is ruined.

The employee notified the Transportation Manager who in turn notified the CN Dangerous Goods Team. The tank car was set out to an isolation track for inspection by a CN emergency response contractor. A CN emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the location for mitigation. Contractor performed an inspection of the tank car and found the bottom outlet valve to be leaking from the threads of the bottom outlet valve cap as a result of the BOV not creating a proper seal and the BOV cap not tight enough to contain the leak. (The BOV cap was found to be less than tool tight and the BOV valve in the closed position and pinned upon initial inspection). HMR did observe cable seals to be correctly in place. The BOV valve handle was cycled several times to the open and closed position to free any debris that may have been trapped in the BOV sealing surface potentially causing the leak. The BOV cap was then removed and observed for 20 minutes to ensure there was no further leakage from the valve. It was noted that the BOV cap gasket was deformed and was replaced. The bottom outlet valve cap was then re-installed and tightened with a 36"" pipe wrench. Upon tightening the BOV cap, Contractor proceeded to place new cable seals on the BOV / Cap.",No comments provided,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,20000,WC,US,

The employee notified the Transportation Manager who in turn notified the CN Dangerous Goods Team. The tank car was set out to an isolation track (WA90) for inspection by a CN emergency response contractor. A CN emergency response contractor was dispatched to the location for mitigation. The contractor performed an inspection of the tank car and found the bottom outlet valve to be leaking from the threads of the bottom outlet valve cap. It was determined that there was a failure in the sealing surface of the valve seat to include a defective gasket. (The BOV cap was found to be tool tight and the BOV in the closed position and pinned upon initial inspection). CN emergency response contractor did observe cable seal to be correctly in place. The BOV valve handle was cycled several times to the open and closed position to free any debris that may have been trapped in the BOV sealing surface potentially causing the leak. The BOV cap was then removed and observed for 20 minutes to ensure there was no further leakage from the valve. It was noted that the BOV cap gasket was deformed and was replaced. The bottom outlet valve cap was then re-installed and tightened with a 36"" pipe wrench. Upon tightening the BOV cap, CN emergency response contractor proceeded to place new cable seals on the BOV / Cap.",No comments provided,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,25632,WC,US,

Immediately after the oncoming truck passes the bobtail driver corrects his line of travel back up on the road surface.  and crosses the left lane, out of control, and leaves the pavement into the ditch, striking a group of trees.  During the impact, a section of piping for propane vapor on the rear of the bobtail is sheared off, resulting in a propane release.  The driver was able to slow the leak at the cargo tank within 5 minutes by reseating the excess flow valve where the piping had been sheared off.   A secondary bobtail truck responded to the scene and was able to safely empty the damaged bobtail by transferring the propane into the secondary truck.  The damaged bobtail was towed to an impound lot that evening.

During product handling at the Wilbur-Ellis' facility in Rosebud, TX. A Wilbur-Ellis' employee was moving a 250-gallon tote containing Grayzon Next Herbicide when he cut a turn short, resulting in a puncture to the bottom of the tote. Approximately 250 gallons of free product released, mostly inside of secondary containment. A small amount of the product, approximately 20 gallons, escaped secondary containment, with 15 gallons hitting concrete, and 5 gallons hitting gravel. There was no reported impact to water. There were no reported injuries or exposures. Wilbur-Ellis' personnel reviewed the SOS and responded with appropriate PPE. The product from the impacted tote was recovered and placed into a secondary tote. The impacted gravel and free product was recovered into containers, and will be disposed of via the facility's waste stream.","Since the release was accident, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Daikin America, Inc., was notified via CHEMTREC (Report #2024-0203-00008). Hulls Environmental, a CSXT emergency response contractor, and Josh Dearing, a CSX Manager of Hazardous Materials, were dispatched to the scene.  Response personnel found that 1 of 4 liquid line closure flange bolts were less than tool tight.  Response personnel properly tightened the liquid line closure flange bolts and stopped the release.

EnviroServe, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the product leaking from the liquid line valve mounting flange as a result of the mounting flange bolts being less than tool tight. Contractor personnel tightened the flange bolts to stop the release. The issue identified and corrective action were communicated to the shipper’s representative (Timothy Albert, 740-533-5200).

The car was isolated and the shipper, Valero Marketing, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report # 2024-02-14-00201). HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, and Blaise MacDonald, a CSXT hazardous materials manager, were dispatched to the scene and found the manway cover was mis-aligned allowing the release; additionally,  seven out of eight manway cover bolts were less than tool tight. Response personnel inspected the manway cover gasket and properly secured the manway cover for transportation.

Further inspection revealed: (1) of the (4) flange securement fasteners was not properly tightened and could be freely moved by hand. The 1"" air valve was in the completely open position with its securement plug securely installed. The 2"" liquid eduction line securement cap was less than tool tight (could be turned by hand. The loose liquid eduction line cap was the source of the leak. The tank car's internal pressure was relieved through the 1"" air valve stopping the leak. The Liquid eduction line securement cap was properly tightened with an 18"" pipe wrench. The 1"" air valve was closed, and its securement plug was properly tightened with an 18"" pipe wrench. The tank car was then decontaminated by a CN hired contractor. A contractor hired by the responsible party replaced all (4) liquid eduction line flange bolts and securement nuts.

During the Inspection Mr. Perkins cited ECUX 461228 because it was leaking  OCTYL ALCOHOL from the bottom outlet valve (BOV) threads past the BOV cap. Estimated release was  less than 0.5 gallon. A railroad qualified response contractor was mobilized to investigate and  mitigate the leak.  Upon arrival, responders found ECUX 46 1228 with a BOV not secured tool tight, and the presence of  product weeping around the threads of the BOV cap. The BOV was in the fully closed position, but  responders observed that the four-inch bottom outlet ball valve had a small amount of product on  the 8-L side of the ball. 1-2 drops fell every 2-3 minutes. Additionally, the four inch bottom  outlet flange gasket was observed to be out of round and slightly warped, although the release was  not related to the warped gasket. The BOV cap was tightened tool tight with PTFE tape to stop the  weeping. The response contractor placed an out of service tag on the BOV, and applied HOMESHOP  stickers to both sides of the tank car.  The contractor climbed ECUX 461228 and observed the manway with a single loose manway swing bolt.  The manway cover seal was cut, all swing bolts loosened, and the manway opened. The manway gasket  was verified in good condition. The manway was then closed, and the manway swing bolts were secured  to tool tight.  Responders returned to Cordova, IL on the following day and verified that ECUX 461228 was not  leaking prior to the car being switched into the 3M facility. This move (400 ft) was made under the  emergency provisions of 174.5, with a verbal notification made by Houdyshell to FRA. The car was  subsequently unloaded by 3M and then an OTMA was obtained to move the car to home shop by  ExxonMobil.  File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated based on the best information available at  the time of filing. This shipment was offered as a ""bulk"" shipment, aka one car load, therefore the exact amount offered in this package is not known to the carrier. This carrier does not have access to mass balance data which can exactly quantify this value.","The SOO LINE RAILROAD COMPANY (DBA CPKC) notified shipper of this release. Continued emphasis is made with Offerors/Shippers to conduct thorough inspections prior to movement in order to reduce valve failures In the field. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For NARs (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper Is requested to conduct a root-cause Investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with CPKC. Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Tony Houdyshell, SOO Line Railroad, 120 S 6th ST STE 900, Minneapolis, MN 55402.

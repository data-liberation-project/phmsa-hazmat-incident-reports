When I arrived to look at the car, I could see that is was leaking product from the protective housing on top the car.  I got on top the car and removed seal number 451443 from the protective housing cover and noticed that product was leaking from the Sample Line Valve.   Product was leaking from the valve plug.  I checked to see of the valve handle was shut and it was not tight.  I turned the valve handle one complete turn before it was shut tight.  I then checked to see if the valve plug was loose and when I touched the plug, it fell out.  I installed new thread sealant on the plug and installed it in the valve and tightened it tool tight.  I then cleaned off the top and sides of the car the best I could.

I checked to see of the valve handle was shut and it was not tight.  I turned the valve handle one complete turn before it was shut tight.  I then checked to see if the valve plug was loose and when I touched the plug, it fell out.  I installed new thread sealant on the plug and installed it in the valve and tightened it tool tight.

The car was isolated and The Shipper, Altivia, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report 2024-0201-00063). EnviroServe, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the product leaking from the liquid line valve mounting flange as a result of the mounting flange bolts being less than tool tight. Contractor personnel tightened the flange bolts to stop the release. The issue identified and corrective action were communicated to the shipper’s representative (Timothy Albert, 740-533-5200).

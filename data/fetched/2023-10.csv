Approximately 30 minutes after takeoff, the flight returned to Miami International Airport due to the detection of a strong chemical smell from the Main Deck.     2. Cargo Area Inspection:     Upon the flight's return to Miami International Airport, the Miami Dade Fire Department was called to investigate the situation. They requested that the Main Deck be opened to ventilate the area and check for any potential leakage of dangerous goods.     3. Identification of the Chemical:     During the inspection, a pallet in position 2R was identified to contain RFL UN1089 Acetaldehyde. This pallet was promptly removed from its position for further examination. It was later determined that there was no spill of the substance either on the pallet or on the floor of the aircraft.     4. Safety Measures and Gas Dissipation:     Following the removal of the pallet, the Miami Dade Fire Department allowed the aircraft to remain open for approximately 30 minutes to ensure proper ventilation and to monitor the situation. After this time, the Fire Department’s team conducted a cargo inspection and, having found no further issues, cleared the plane for operation. The pallet involved in the incident was isolated for an additional 40 minutes to allow any lingering gases to dissipate, making it safe for handling.     5. Preliminary Investigation Findings:     During the preliminary investigation, it was confirmed that all procedures for handling dangerous goods were followed correctly. While there may have been a partial smell of non-toxic gas, it was determined that the packaging containing the Acetaldehyde was not damaged, and therefore, it did not pose a safety risk.",,No,,,,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,LAN CARGO S.A.,US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, Veolia, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report # 2023-10-10-00231). Marion Environmental Inc. (MEI), a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found a pressure relief vent with a blown rupture.  While replacing the rupture disc on the car, contractor personnel also determined that the pressure relief device was not equipped with the required hydraulic surge protection.  Contractor personnel removed the blown rupture disk and installed a new 2” SS 165 psi rupture disk, decontaminated the exterior of the tank car to ensure no hazardous residue was present as a result of the release, and remediated the environmental impact to the track area. All issues identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper’s representative- Jeff Humphries. As a result of this release, a CSX employee was splashed with liquid was released from the car during normal switching operations. The employee was able to removing the impacted clothing and decontaminate themselves; the employee refused any medical treatment.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2500,CSX CORPORATION,US,

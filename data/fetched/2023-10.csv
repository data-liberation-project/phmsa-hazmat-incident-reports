Approximately 30 minutes after takeoff, the flight returned to Miami International Airport due to the detection of a strong chemical smell from the Main Deck.     2. Cargo Area Inspection:     Upon the flight's return to Miami International Airport, the Miami Dade Fire Department was called to investigate the situation. They requested that the Main Deck be opened to ventilate the area and check for any potential leakage of dangerous goods.     3. Identification of the Chemical:     During the inspection, a pallet in position 2R was identified to contain RFL UN1089 Acetaldehyde. This pallet was promptly removed from its position for further examination. It was later determined that there was no spill of the substance either on the pallet or on the floor of the aircraft.     4. Safety Measures and Gas Dissipation:     Following the removal of the pallet, the Miami Dade Fire Department allowed the aircraft to remain open for approximately 30 minutes to ensure proper ventilation and to monitor the situation. After this time, the Fire Department’s team conducted a cargo inspection and, having found no further issues, cleared the plane for operation. The pallet involved in the incident was isolated for an additional 40 minutes to allow any lingering gases to dissipate, making it safe for handling.     5. Preliminary Investigation Findings:     During the preliminary investigation, it was confirmed that all procedures for handling dangerous goods were followed correctly. While there may have been a partial smell of non-toxic gas, it was determined that the packaging containing the Acetaldehyde was not damaged, and therefore, it did not pose a safety risk.",,No,,,,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,LAN CARGO S.A.,US,

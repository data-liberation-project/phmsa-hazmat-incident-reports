The investigation revealed that during the cleanout the 3rd party had removed the cleanout port cap on top of the tanker and didn't fully secure the cap once the tanker was cleaned out.  The tanker was then sent to pickup a load at PPG Industries, the driver only checked the top hatch and hose valves after loading.  Upon leaving the shipping facility the driver stopped at a scale 40 miles away, there was no evidence at this time of any release.  Upon reaching his final destination he noticed material had sprayed out of the top of the tanker from the top of the tanker from the cleanout port.  The cap was still affixed but he was able to hand tighten it.  Based upon scale tickets from the beginning and end of his trip we were able to determine the amount that had released 45lbs = 5 gallons.

The CPKC Hazmat Department  mobilized, along with a response contractor, to investigate and mitigate the release.  Upon assessment, responders found that the pressure relief device (PRD) had actuated releasing approximately 0.5 gallons of commodity. The tank car was then moved with reacher cars to an  isolation track where it was decontaminated to a 7 pH. The package was inspected and not found to  be overloaded or over pressured. CPKC Hazmat concluded that the PRD might be defective. The shipper  was contacted and advised that the tank car is currently a FRA non-specification package and  required that the PRD be tested and proved to be functioning, or replaced by a qualified MRU.  Shipper was also made aware that the car would need a FRA OTMA before it could be moved. As of the  date of this filing, the shipper and car owner are working to verify proper PRD operation before  the car will be released back into rail transportation.   File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated based on the best information available at  the time of filing. This shipment was offered as a 'bulk' shipment, aka one car load, therefore the  exact amount offered in this package is not known to the carrier. This carrier does not have access  to mass balance data which can exactly quantify this value.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.(Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

The Chattanooga Fire Department responded and Marion Environmental, Inc. (MEI) was contracted, by Greatwide, to perform cleanup and environmental remediation. During the incident, one tote containing organic peroxide solution was crushed, causing material to spill from multiple pinch points in the plastic tote. A 2nd tote spilled approximately 150 gallons from a broken lid on the fill port. Approx 270 gallons total of material spilled into the trailer, onto 100 feet of roadway, and into a storm water drain. The drain flows to Moccasin Bend Water Treatment Facility (MBWTF). No organic peroxide solution entered a natural waterway or soil. All spilled material was contained in the trailer, on the roadway, and the storm water drain. After coordinating with MBWTF personnel, the fire department flushed the drain and  pushed all spilled material into the MBWTF for treatment. Sand was placed on the roadway and around the doors of the trailer to contain the spill. MEI personnel pumped the contents from all 13 of the original totes and transferred the product into 15 new totes. The shipper transported the empty totes and new totes containing product back to their facility. MEI cleaned the interior of the trailer and roadway.",No comments provided.,Yes,IBC,"Metal, for liquids or solids",31N,Yes,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,119775,"CUSTARD INSURANCE ADJUSTERS, INC.",US,

Vehicle 1 was reentering the roadway from the right shoulder and vehicle 2 stuck the rear end of vehicle 1 at a speed of 71 mph. Both vehicles came to  rest on the north shoulder facing west. Emergency response personnel arriving at the scene contacted CHEMTREC Emergency Services as vehicle 2 was carrying radioactive materials in Type A packaging. The Battalion Chief on the scene reported to CHEMTREC that he did not believe the load was compromised or releasing product. Battalion Chief then contacted the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) from our Macon GA pharmacy to inform him of the accident. Jubilant Radiopharma RSO inform the Battalion Chief that all radioactive materials in the vehicle were well below limited quantity activity limits and there was no immediate danger to emergency personnel. Discussion between the Jubilant RSO, Battalion Chief and Georgia State Police  regarding the radioactive material packages confirmed that all 6 packages were limited quantity  shipments of radioactive material. All contents remained in the packages and all inner packaging's remained fully sealed and showed no damage. There was no release of any radioactive material to the environment.",The Georgia State Police (GSP) investigation is still on-going. Jubilant Radiopharma drivers are trained/instructed to refrain from engaging in distracting activities while operating a company vehicle.

I came out to look at the car and used a gas detection meter on the protective house and confirmed that this car was leaking.

The valve was leaking through the valve plug threads.  I tightened the valve and the leak stopped.  It took about an 1/8 of a turn to stop the leak.  I then tightened the valve plug.

The cap was then removed and the valve was monitored for 10 minutes for any continued leakage. There was no longer any leakage from the valve at this point. An inspection of the BOV cap gasket was performed and revealed it to be very stiff allowing the product to leak past the gasket.

Approximately 30 minutes after takeoff, the flight returned to Miami International Airport due to the detection of a strong chemical smell from the Main Deck.     2. Cargo Area Inspection:     Upon the flight's return to Miami International Airport, the Miami Dade Fire Department was called to investigate the situation. They requested that the Main Deck be opened to ventilate the area and check for any potential leakage of dangerous goods.     3. Identification of the Chemical:     During the inspection, a pallet in position 2R was identified to contain RFL UN1089 Acetaldehyde. This pallet was promptly removed from its position for further examination. It was later determined that there was no spill of the substance either on the pallet or on the floor of the aircraft.     4. Safety Measures and Gas Dissipation:     Following the removal of the pallet, the Miami Dade Fire Department allowed the aircraft to remain open for approximately 30 minutes to ensure proper ventilation and to monitor the situation. After this time, the Fire Department’s team conducted a cargo inspection and, having found no further issues, cleared the plane for operation. The pallet involved in the incident was isolated for an additional 40 minutes to allow any lingering gases to dissipate, making it safe for handling.     5. Preliminary Investigation Findings:     During the preliminary investigation, it was confirmed that all procedures for handling dangerous goods were followed correctly. While there may have been a partial smell of non-toxic gas, it was determined that the packaging containing the Acetaldehyde was not damaged, and therefore, it did not pose a safety risk.",,No,,,,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,LAN CARGO S.A.,US,

Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 5-gallons of product released to a 10’ x 30’ area of the trailer and concrete lot below. The release occurred due to high temps expanding the totes/loose caps as well as small puncture holes in the tote bodies. The material in the three totes were transferred into new totes. Soda ash was utilized to neutralize the release & absorbents were then deployed to clean all released product. All impacted absorbents were containerized into a 55-gallon poly drum.

The driver attempted to make a 90 degree turn to the left from one roadway to another at an intersection. The vehicle's speed was too fast for conditions. The liquid load surged to the passenger side of the vehicle. The sudden weight shift to the right side caused the unit to roll over onto its right (passenger) side. The vehicle came to rest partially on the pavement and the grassy shoulder on the right side of the roadway. The driver exited from the tractor cab by crawling through the windshield frame opening. As the vehicle was lying on its right side, the liquid level rose above the manhole/venting fixtures. Gasoline began seeping through the venting fixture. The local fire department and HM response personnel placed absorbent materials around the unit. HM response personnel performed a ""cold tap"" drilling procedure on the side of the semi-trailer. A suction hose and pump was used to transfer product from the overturned unit into a recovery cargo tank motor vehicle.  After off loading was completed, product measurements revealed approximately 450 gallons of gasoline had leaked through the venting fixture. The leaked product found its way to the ground surface alongside the pavement.  Lone Star HazMat response is handing the removal and replacement of any contaminated earth alongside of the pavement.","All drivers within the company were shown the on-board video that illustrates the rollover.

The car was isolated and the shipper, National Response Center, and Maryland Department of the Environment were notified.  Specialized Professional Services, Inc., a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the B-End liquid valve and vapor valve partially open and the secondary closure plugs improperly installed resulting in an active release of lading. The issues were identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper, Mr. Derek Campbell of Kiros Energy, phone 403.483.1250. Contractor personnel closed both open valves and properly installed the secondary closure plugs in accordance with 49 CFR 173.31. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport.

When the box was moved on the van, the driver heard glass moving around and saw some pieces of glass fall out of the box. The driver immediately put the box into a plastic container and call the QA team. The box was removed from the vehicle. A manager notified. Everyone noticed the box was 100% dry but it sounded like broken glass. Upon inspection, saw 2 of the glass gallon containers were broken. No liquid inside. The cardboard did look like it had been wet at one time and dried. The small pieces of glass inside the van was swept up and put into the plastic container. The plastic container with the hazmat inside was brought to the Hazmat cage. DescribePack: The glass of two of the four bottles inside had broken. Since the box was already dry and had no damage to it I can not state exactly what had happened. I do know there was 3 inches of empty space on the top of the box. This would cause the glass bottles to be able to move around during transit. The bottles, even though they had the paper molds on the bottom and on the top, the bottles could still move around inside the box. The two bottles that had broken broke in the center of the bottles. The top seemed to be okay and the very bottom glass was okay. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: The  methanol inside the broken bottles had already evaporated. The box was totally dry. To minimize any more broken bottles, the box was but inside a plastic bin and transported to the hazmat cage.

Upon coupling into a stationary cut of cars, product was observed releasing from the top of one of the railcars. The local Dangerous Goods Officer (DGO) was immediately notified of the release. Upon arrival at the yard, the DGO observed product on the exterior of RCRX 1684 (load / UN 1789 / Class 8).  The railcar was further investigated and inspected, observing liquid around the housing and in the bowl of the external spring safety relief device indicating activation of the safety relief valve. The liquid was tested with pH paper indicating a pH of 1-2. All top fittings and closures were inspected and found to be tool tight.  The railcar was observed for 45 minutes, with no additional product observed releasing. The exterior of the railcar was decontaminated.

The forklift had a double drum attachment which was used to pick up and move the drums. The employee raised the forklift but he failed to lift the drums high enough which resulted in one of the drum being smashed between the drum attachment stabilizing bar and the trailer floor frame. This resulted in one of the drums being crushed and causing a leak. Another employee got on the forklift and quickly brought the drums down to the ground and disengaged the drum grabber so that the drum could be tilted to the side to minimize the spill. Other Veolia employees quickly grabbed absorbent and contained the spill. The damaged drum was placed into an 85 gal poly salvage drum and absorbent was used to cleaned the area.  Pressure washer was used to decontaminated the affected area. The spilled occurred on asphalt and did not result in release to the environment.","Following the incident, an investigation was completed and resulted in the employee involved with the incident being terminated from employment with Veolia.

Contractor personnel determined that 6 of the 6 manway cover swing bolts were less than tool tight. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper’s representative: Mike Ernst (214-871-3590). Contractor personnel properly secured the manway swing bolts using a 24” wrench; this stopped all product vapor from leaking.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1000,CSX Transportation,US,

Vehicle 1 was an auto which stopped in  the right lane of the travel portion of the 70 MPH roadway blocking the right travel lane of the  roadway. Vehicle 2 a truck stopped directly behind the auto or was in the process of coming to a  halt to render assistance. Vehicle 3 consisting of a truck-tractor semi-trailer cargo tank in the  right lane was unable to stop and made contact with vehicle 2 which made contact with vehicle 1.  Vehicle 2 fuel tank exploded causing flames to engulf both vehicle 2 and the truck-tractor of  vehicle 3. It appears that materials being transported in vehicle 2, including cylinders, exploded  adding to the fire. Heat from the flames caused the Jet Fuel to build pressure causing release of the PRV and those vapors lit adding to the heat factor. Heat caused the right top portion of the cargo tank to melt releasing product onto the roadway which lit.  Fire response units used foam to extinguish the tanker portion of the fire and water to handle the  tire portion.  Driver in Vehicle 3 along with driver and passenger in vehicle 2 died as a result of the flames.  Driver Vehicle 1 was cited by PA State Police for causing the crash and issued several citations.",None at this time.,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,0,NATC Inc,US,

Further investigation revealed that a 55 gallon drum had over pressurized and spilled chemicals. The spill was contained within the trailer and did not exit out or under the trailer. The Veolia employees cleaned up the spill caused by the overpressure of the drum and put the drum inside a 851H2 overpack, the residues of material collected from the spill were also put inside the same overpack.","Veolia has been picking up from this customer for about 5 years on a frequency of once every 1-2 weeks from the customer's waste storage area and has never had this issue before. The customer would put an inhibitor into the containers when they were placed in the storage area and they would sit in storage for at least a week until Veolia picked them up. The customer recently demolished their on-site storage area for building additions and requested Veolia to come weekly for service pick ups. Historically, the customer would apply hydroquinone as an inhibitor to the waste at least 48 hours prior to Veolia's pick up service to ensure neutralization and any reaction is completed prior to offering the drums for transportation. Following the incident, discussion with the customer revealed that the hydroquinone was added to the waste drum on the same day Veolia picked up the waste container. The hydroquinone inhibitor should be applied at least 48 hours prior to our pick up service to ensure the neutralization reaction is completed. The practice of the 48 hour waiting period was done in all previous service pick ups with no incidents. The customer has agreed to apply the hydroquinone inhibitor on Fridays to ensure the neutralization reaction is completed prior to Veolia picking up the waste on Mondays. The Veolia employees will monitor this procedure very closely and validate in advance the date and time of inhibitor application prior to pick up the drums.",No,,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The driver pulled the package out causing some to spill on a few other packages in the truck. He set the package on the passenger side steps while QA investigated. One QA person called the emergency number who stated they could someone out to clean up or we could clean up if we felt we could handle it. QA placed the package in a red hazmat tote. QA sprinkled the area with neutralizing powder as a safety measure. The spill was soaked up and the clean up materials placed in the salvage drum.

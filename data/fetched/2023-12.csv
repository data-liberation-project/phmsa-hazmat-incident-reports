At 1505 ET, RMS advised they utilizied Chemsorb CA to clean and neutralize the impacted areas. ERTS reached out to RMS for an update. The contractor advised they have begun applying a 30% white vinegar solution to the impacted areas of the spill as the Chemsorb was not proving effective. The vinegar solution has been getting much better results and they have noted no hazardous reactions. The team sprayed the solution and then used spill pads to remove the liquid/residue.

Safety told the driver to stop what she was doing and reached out to another driver close by to see if he could assist, then called the AMLO terminal.  They found there was a check valve failure, and it wouldn’t close.  They also found the trailer didn’t have some of the fittings needed and the other driver supplied them.  Bleeder fitting was on the other end at customers connection instead of truck side. Driver couldn’t connect it to truck side due to not having the correct fittings so she connected to customers end connection before it goes into the building.   When Driver went to open an ear on the fitting, it sprayed out, and they didn’t realize pressure was on the hose.   Customer mentioned it was water soluble and sprayed down concrete with water and the drivers’ chemical suits.  Driver mentions that after talking with the customer, their valve was open on the inside of the building and their system had pressure on it causing to backflow into the truck hose.  Customer closed valve inside building and both drivers drain what they could in the hoses and cap hoses.

Once they started offloading the trailer began dripping 2 drips every 5 seconds.  They were able to contain the leak to a bucket and finished the offload so it could be sent for repairs.  We're a bit surprised it started leaking at the time it did.  Usually when doing a pump offload it creates a 'vacuum' away from the source of the leak and slows it down.  In this case this is when it started leaking.  I likely has to do with when the internal valve was opened though that allowed it to get to the sump gasket.  That is what actually leaked.,Its hard to say if the gasket was bad due to age / deterioration or if the valve bolts werent torqued enough anymore.  The trailer is coming due for its annual inspection.  This is not something we are seeing repeat incidents of and feel this is an isolated incident and do not see the need for any operational changes at this time.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"SCHNEIDER NATIONAL BULK CARRIERS, INC.",US,

One QA person called the emergency number who stated they could someone out to clean up or we could clean up if we felt we could handle it. QA placed the package in a red hazmat tote. QA sprinkled the area with neutralizing powder as a safety measure. The spill was soaked up and the clean up materials placed in the salvage drum.

Further investigation revealed that a 55 gallon drum had over pressurized and spilled chemicals. The spill was contained within the trailer and did not exit out or under the trailer. The Veolia employees cleaned up the spill caused by the overpressure of the drum and put the drum inside a 851H2 overpack, the residues of material collected from the spill were also put inside the same overpack.","Veolia has been picking up from this customer for about 5 years on a frequency of once every 1-2 weeks from the customer's waste storage area and has never had this issue before. The customer would put an inhibitor into the containers when they were placed in the storage area and they would sit in storage for at least a week until Veolia picked them up. The customer recently demolished their on-site storage area for building additions and requested Veolia to come weekly for service pick ups. Historically, the customer would apply hydroquinone as an inhibitor to the waste at least 48 hours prior to Veolia's pick up service to ensure neutralization and any reaction is completed prior to offering the drums for transportation. Following the incident, discussion with the customer revealed that the hydroquinone was added to the waste drum on the same day Veolia picked up the waste container. The hydroquinone inhibitor should be applied at least 48 hours prior to our pick up service to ensure the neutralization reaction is completed. The practice of the 48 hour waiting period was done in all previous service pick ups with no incidents. The customer has agreed to apply the hydroquinone inhibitor on Fridays to ensure the neutralization reaction is completed prior to Veolia picking up the waste on Mondays. The Veolia employees will monitor this procedure very closely and validate in advance the date and time of inhibitor application prior to pick up the drums.",No,,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The employee notified the Yard Supervisor who then initiated an emergency response from the CN Dangerous Goods Team. The responding DG Officer observed liquid dripping from the BOV cap which was found to be tool tight (could not turn by hand). The shipper's security seal was not found. BOV handle was in the fully closed position. It was determined that there was a failure in the sealing surface of the valve seat to include a defective or missing BOV gasket. The BOV handle was cycled several times from the closed to open position to ensure there was no foreign material trapped in the valve seat that would prevent a proper seal. The cap was then removed, and the valve was monitored for 10 minutes for any continued leakage. There was no longer any leakage from the valve at this point. An inspection of the BOV cap gasket was performed and revealed it to be very stiff allowing the product to leak past the gasket. The BOV gasket was replaced, and the cap re-installed utilizing a 24"" pipe wrench.",No comments provided,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,17000,Illinois Central,US,

It was reported that due to a forklift incident, approximately .25 gallon of Conquest (hazardous - UN1824) was released and is no longer leaking. The caller stated that the released product was contained to the trailer floor. ERTS reviewed the SDS with the caller and they felt comfortable cleaning the release donning the proper PPE per SDS. The released product, damaged drum, and oil-dri will be placed into an 85-gallon poly drum and staged in OS&D. There were no drains, soils or waterways reported to have been impacted by the release. There is no regulatory reporting required for this release. ERTS will upload the BOL, SDS and create a waste container entry. ERTS contacted Charles (Chemtrec) who provided report #2024110600102.

Upon entering highway traffic, the driver encountered vehicles that were not merging correctly and driving aggressively. They brake checked each other and the truck driver had to do emergency braking maneuver to avoid collision with the 2 other vehicles. The load shifted forward, and 2 IBCs shifted and pushed barrels together after the load securement failed. The drum of ferric chloride was crushed by one of the other barrels, causing a crack at the bottom corner of the barrel. The duration of the release was approximately 1.5 hours. The local fire department was called and was on scene along with WY DOT personnel as it happened at the Wyoming Port of Entry. The Laramie County fire department had sand delivered and built a berm and used absorbent to stop the spread of the spill.  Clean Harbors was contacted by the company to handle the remediation.  The fire department left the scene once the leak stopped and Clean Harbors was enroute from Denver, CO.  Clean Harbors unloaded the trailer in order to find the compromised drum, which was put into a 95-gallon overpack to contain and neutralize it with soda ash.  The crew then decontaminated the trailer using a mix of water and speedy dry.  All waste associated with the decontamination was then shoveled and wiped into a 55-gallon poly drum which was picked up the following day.",Additional training was given to the driver. Logistics posts on van trailers are not meant to hold up to moving IBCs. It Would be nice if they had sections that were steel and not aluminum.

BPRR management promptly implemented their emergency response plan and isolated the rail car.  The shipper, MPLX on behalf of Foster Gas was notified via CHEMTREC's report number 2024-11-20-00093.  Additionally, the National Response Center (report# 1416851) was contacted regarding the release of product.  Shawn Dunkle, MPLX Operations Supervisor, responded and discovered that the liquid line was partially open and the secondary closure camlock cap gasket was missing.  Mr. Dunkle closed the liquid line valve and installed a new cam lock cap gasket to secure the container.  To ensure the railcar's service equipment was working as designed, MPLX requested a post load securement test be performed.  Specialized Professional Services (SPSI) pressured up the container to 15psi and found that the liquid line valve was defective (ball valve bypass).  On 12/11/2024, SPSI performed a product transfer into tank car CBTX721426.  The car owner, CIT Group is in the process of making arrangements to replace the defective liquid line valve.

Contractors were dispatched to the site to perform all onsite clean-up activities. Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of 30 gallons of Phosphoric Acid Solution (UN1805, 8, III) from (1) 60-gallon plastic drum onto the trailer floor and outside pavement. The release was reportedly due to a puncture from a pallet, impacting a 17’ x 8’ area in the trailer and 7’ x 100’ area on the pavement. No drains or waterways were impacted by the release. The release was neutralized then cleaned up with absorbents and the proper PPE. The damaged drum with the remaining product was placed into an overpack to move on with the client. Undamaged products were re-loaded and re-secured in the trailer. All waste generated from addressing this release was containerized in (7) 55-gallon DF, which were then staged onsite by the contractor for proper disposal.",no comment provided,No,                             ,,,No,,,,,,,64,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,8000,"EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND TRAINING SOLUTIONS, INCORPORATED",US,

During this procedure, one of the employees, who was relatively new to the department and task, attempted to collect a sample by disconnecting the hose from the tanker's bottom valve.  As the employee unfastened one of the camlock's dog ears, the hose suddenly detached, resulting in an unexpected release of approximately 60 gallons of material. Fortunately, the spill was contained within the designated secondary containment area, which consisted of a concrete pad surrounded by a protective berm.  The employee who had been disconnecting the hose was directly exposed to the liquid. Following safety protocols, they immediately utilized the nearby safety shower to decontaminate. Meanwhile, the second employee promptly shut off the external valve on the tanker to halt the flow of liquid and then notified the Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) department about the incident.","The Veolia facility is working to improve their training program, including initial sign off of procedures and associated train the trainer program.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

Recognizing the potential hazard, the employee halted the operation and attempted to properly secure the drum onto the cart. Unfortunately, during this adjustment, the cart suddenly slipped away from the drum, causing it to fall. The drum's impact with the metal feet of the cart resulted in a puncture near its top section. Reacting swiftly, the employee rotated the drum to minimize further liquid leakage. To contain the situation, the damaged drum was promptly overpacked on the customer's premises.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Centennial Energy was notified via CHEMTREC (Report # 2024-11-11-00010).  Marion Environmental Inc.

Upon further inspection it was found to have the B-end liquid valve partially open; and the secondary closure plug less than tool tight with no thread tape applied. The vapor valve was also found to be partially open with the secondary closure plug less than tool tight without thread tape.

It was reported that approximately 1 ounce of ConvoClean Forte released from 1) 2.5 Gallon plastic container due to improper loading. The release impacted trailer # 4631484. No storm drains or waterways are reported to be impacted by the release.   A contractor was dispatched and observed an estimated 1-quart release onto the wooden trailer floor in a 12’x3’ area. The contractor applied citric acid to neutralize the release and used absorbent pads to clean-up the release.

Our employee looked up the SDS sheet online, seen it was a dangerous goods product and rejected the shipment. Attempt#2 The same driver came back at approximately 1403 with a different package. Our Cargo Agent helped him and created the air waybill to accept the shipment. However, our Crew Chief who handled the first attempt noticed the same driver. She had the accepting Cargo·Agent open the package to inspect it and found that it was the same product however it was not in the original package. The shipper took everything out of the original packages and put it in one different package. The shipment was then rejected again. It was also noted that there was no DG placard displayed on the vehicle this product was transported in by highway. Pictures and screenshots will be submitted.","We are in the process of advising all of our stations so that they are aware and to be diligent when accepting and inspecting cargo.

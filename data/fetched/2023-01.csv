The car was isolated and Americas Styrenics were notified (CHEMTREC Report #2023010500192). SPSI, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found that vapors were being released from the vacuum relief valve. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Kevin Wheat; 832-381-4624. Contractor personnel released pressure and removed the Vacuum Relief Valve and replaced it with a thread plug. SPSI applied 5lbs of nitrogen to the car and checked for leaks.  No leaks detected. An approved OTMA will be required prior to movement to destination.

When the trailer departed Fort Hill on 1/6/2023, nothing abnormal was observed by the site, the driver, or site security.  The trailer was being transported by Hazmat Enviromental LLC.   Shortly after the trailer had left the Fort Hill site enroute to the customer, the driver transporting trailer DT314 observed what was described as a haze coming from the covered crash box of the trailer when the driver slowed or stopped.  The driver indicated the haze was nearly unnoticeable while the trailer was in transit. This observation by the driver occurred at approximately 30 minutes after departing Fort Hill.  The driver notified his dispatch and the Fort Hill Plant Site.  The carrier notified Chemtrec per Veolia procedure.  The driver immediately returned to the Fort Hill Site with the trailer.  The trailer was returned to the Fort Hill site at 1010.  The exact time duration of the vapor release is unknown, but based on the driver's observation, it is estimated to have been approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour.  The Fort Hill site observed a light acid mist (vapor / fumes) coming from the WECO Cap of the liquid loading line. Upon further inspection it was determined the gasket sealing the WECO Cap to the liquid line valve spool, was misaligned and did not create a sufficient seal.    This closure (the WECO Cap)  is the secondary closure outside of the loading liquid line valve and outside of the tankers primary closure system.  Sulfur Trioxide residue was present in this spool section, above the liquid line valve, and below the installed WECO Cap.  With the gasket misaligned, it is suspected this allowed that minimal residue to absorb moisture in the air and then omit visible vapor / fumes.  The gasket sealing surfaces were cleaned, inspected, and the gasket replaced at the Fort Hill Plant.  The trailer was re-inspected, and the delivery was later made without incident.","Veolia discovered human error in the installation of the Weco Cap gasket by the Veolia Loading Operator allowed the sulfur trioxide residue behind the Weco Cap to release vapor / fumes.  The incident was leverage with all Fort Hill Site Operators as well as all other Veolia Regeneration plant sites. The specific operator involved in the issue was retrained via 2 different job cycle checks (completed 1/13/2023).  Job Cycle checks consist of re-training by observing the operator perform all task related to properly closing S03 tank trailers to confirm sealing surfaces are clean and gaskets are installed correctly.    Job cycle checks are also being performed on this task (on going).   Additionally, Fort Hill is further reviewing procedures and practices for pressing / cupping Weco gaskets prior to their installation.  Pressing / cupping the Weco gasket is a means of preforming the gasket so it properly seats within the plug and cap.   Though not suspected a cause of this issue, opportunities for improvement may exist and changes may be implemented accordingly.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Veolia North America Regeneration Services,US,

ERTS then dispatched contractors to manage all onsite cleanup activities.  Following contractor arrival and assessment of the involved cargo, it was determined that approximately 20 gallons of sodium bisulfite solution was released to a 2’ by 2’ area of gravel beneath the tanker. The release was reportedly due to a leak from the CTMV sleeve. Contractors cleaned up the release using absorbents, hand tools and the proper PPE.  The spent absorbents and all other waste generated were containerized in (3) 55-gallon plastic drums.

Lonestar arrived on site and located the tanker and approximately 4 gallons spilled with only 3 or 4 oz on the ground in a 6"" area. The majority of the spill was on the back of the tanker.  Lonestar advised that when wiping the tanker, it was smearing around, according to the SDS the product is insoluble, so the crew wiped down the sides of the tanker as well as the brakes and tires with brake cleaner and degreaser.

During normal sort procedures a box was offered to the spill clean up specialist which had a stain on the side of the fibreboard box indicating a spill within. Before Further inspection, it was noted the stain on the package smelled of gasoline or some other sort of stringent cleaner. Further inspection of the package found what appeared to a machine part of some kind. The part was wrap in a plastic moisture barrier. Bubble wrap was reported used as dunnage, and PIG mats were placed on the bottom of the box. A call to the shipper from DG Admin confirmed this was a used fuel pump from an aircraft which was out for repair. The fluid was reported by the shipper as jet fuel. This package was not marked nor labeled to inform others of the dangerous good in apparatus contained in the package.

The puncture was caused by a drum cart while moving it onto a trailer in the 10-day transfer area at the Veolia office. The employees immediately noticed the leak and quickly set the drum down to keep it from leaking more by placing it on its side to prevent it from leaking further.  The punctured drum was overpacked into an 851A2 salvage drum to continue transportation to the ultimate disposal facility.     The drum leaked approximately 1/2 gallon of class 6.1 III waste Trichloroethylene. The liquid was cleaned up with spill pads and absorbent and the drum was over-packed into an appropriate 85 gallon salvage drum along with the clean up materials. The duration of release is anticipated to be about 1 minute due to the small hole and quick response.  The drum was still substantially full after the leak occurred.",On 1/07/2023 the Veolia safety manager was notified of the incident. The results of the safety manager's investigation is that a newer employee was assisting another employee with the shipment. The trailer was being filled with containers and the employee was immediately aware that they had poked a hole in the drum. Human error did have a role in this incident. The employee who loaded the trailer was reminded to be more careful when loading drums with a drum cart.

The railcar was isolated, all required notifications made. CN Response Team responded to the location from Gary, Indiana.  The cause of release is determined to be due to debris or an object trapped in the bottom outlet valve preventing a complete seal of the valve seat allowing product to fill and leak out of the improperly secured bottom outlet valve securement cap (BOV cap was not fully tightened.  The BOV cap was tightened approximately 1/2 turn which stopped the leak. The BOV handle was then cycled to the open and closed position 5 times to free any possible obstruction from the valve seat. The BOV cap was completely removed and observed for any additional leakage for 10 minutes. There was no further indication of leakage and the BOV cap was re-applied utilizing a 36"" pipe wrench.

Mechanical personnel reported the TILX 284448, Crude Oil/Load, to be leaking from the top manway area.  KCS mobilized a railroad qualified response contractor to investigate and mitigate the leak. Upon inspection, the contractor identified the liquid line valve to be in the open position with secondary closure plug less than tool tight. Resulting release was approx. 1 gallon.  Corrective action taken was to move liquid line valve to the closed position and secure the secondary closure plug to a tool tight state.  Once car was secured it was released back into transportation.  File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated based on the best information available at the time of filing. This shipment was offered as a 'bulk' shipment, aka one car load, therefore the exact amount offered in this package is not known to the carrier. This carrier does not have access to mass balance data which can exactly quantify this value.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. (Please direct your root cause Investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

Ice build up was observed on V-29 Pressure Build Vapor return valve assembly, V-9 Manual Vent Valve assembly, and the Road Relief Isolation Valve. the Road Relief valve was observed in the open position with a small vapor leak emanating from the valve stem/packing nut assembly. The Road Relief isolation valve packing nut was secured tool tight via wrench application and the valve handle was actuated to the closed position. Water was applied to defrost all valves and fittings. After defrostlng and approximately 10 minute observation, no further leaks were observed. Responders applied zip ties to the valve handles to secure them In the closed position. To ensure the car had been properly secured, BOCX 3038 was evaluated the following morning.

The attempt to tighten the packing nut (gasket) on the internal valve failed, so it was turned off which stopped the leak completely. The system was left off and was locked out and tagged out to ensure no one could re-energize the liquid line. The pnuematic line going to the internal valve was also disconnected to ensure that the acuator could not be filled back with air.  1/30/2023 - System was briefly unlocked and monitored while the remaining liquid was withdrawn from the tank.  2/8/2023-2/10/2023 - Contractor flared off the remaining vapor in the tank and replaced the leaking internal valve with a brand new internal valve.  When replacing, it was noted that the packing inside the valve had been damaged by being tightened to many times. The facility had leaks in the past that they stopped by tightening the packing, but did not replace the internal valve.","An improved procedure has been put in place to that the proper steps are taken to repair valves at the facility in the future.

In the course of incident, the tractor disconnected from the tanker trailer and left the tractor upright while the tanker trailer came to rest on its side in a low-lying area to the east of the unpaved shoulder area. The accident and rollover of the tanker trailer resulted in the release of 5,157 gallons of unleaded gasoline from several damaged compartments onto the unpaved areas within the highway right-of-way (ROW) to the east of US 131 NB. Numerous fire departments, the Michigan State Police (MSP), the Michigan Department of Transportation (MOOT), and Brenner personnel responded to the incident. GFL Environmental (formerly Northern A-1) provided environmental incident response and mobilized to minimize the spread of spilled gasoline, place sorbents, etc. The fuel remaining in the tanker trailer was pumped into another vehicle and properly transported away. Soil excavation activities began on January 24, 2023, with contaminated soils temporarily stockpiled nearby until appropriate off-site disposal could be arranged. Surface water run-off and potentially impacted groundwater is being removed and staged in frac tanks, pending analytical results, after which proper management will occur. Excavated soils are being transported to the Central Sanitary Landfill in Pierson, Michigan, and excavated areas are being backfilled with clean fill.

As the air surgec through the lines the driver began walking to hose towards the trailer to make sure all liquid was purged from the loading hose. Pressure built quickly in the trailer due the small amount of vapor space in the trailer and 120psig air pressure from the plant supply line blowing out the hose. When the trailer pressure reached 25 PSIG the relief lifted to vent pressure from the trailer. The trailer was in a sloped containment which caused the relief valve to be in the liquid phase causing a liquid release of product. As soon as the driver and operator heard/saw the release the air pressure was shut off to the hose and the inlet valve on the trailer was closed. This immediately stopped the release and the relief valve reset without issue.,Prior to loading trailer we need to verify that the trailer is empty and that the loading meter is correctly calibrated to not overfill the trailer. Trailer should not exceed 95% on liquid level gauge.

A railroad qualified response contractor was mobilized to investigate the odor.  Upon arrival, responders Identified SHPX 221270 as the leaking tank car. Responders dawned proper PPE before ascending the car. Once on top of SHPX 221270 , responders found the A-side liquid valve less than tool tight and the A-side liquid valve plug was also less than tool tight. Estimated release was 3 gallons. The liquid valve and the plug were both secured tool tight. Once secure, the rail car was released back Into transportation.  File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated based on the best information available at the time of filing. This shipment was offered as a 'bulk' shipment, aka one car load, therefore the exact amount offered in this package is not known to the carrier. This carrier does not have access to mass balance data which can exactly quantify this value.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.(Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

The car was isolated and Jones Hamilton, Nashville Fire and EMS, TEMA, and NRC were notified CHEMTREC Report #2023-01-05-00033.  Ryan Godsey CSXT hazardous materials manager, and Marion Environmental Inc., a CSX response contractor was dispatched to the scene and found an active vapor release coming from the fittings plate and tank car connection. 20 of 20 fittings plate bolts were found to be less than tool tight. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Sam Perras, 419-666-9838, sperras@jones-hamilton.com. Contractor personnel secured the 20 fittings plate bolts and decontaminated the car. The leak was secured, and the car is currently being held at the terminal until the tank car is properly cleaned & purged, and the fittings plate bolts are properly torqued to manufacturer’s spec. This incident did not require a special switching move.  One CSX employee did have EMS evaluate him and he did go to the hospital. After being evaluated at the hospital he was discharged with no facility administrated medications.","(NAR 212: 212 5 What Failed: Manway, Pressure Plate Where Failed: Connection between manway nozzle and pressure plate Why Failed: Bolts/nuts - less than tool tight)",No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,8505,CSX CORPORATION,US,

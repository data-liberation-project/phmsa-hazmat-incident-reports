Toby notified central dispatch and they told him to contact Billy or myself. I contacted Hazmat One at 524pm and told them to make all the necessary phone calls and to take all waste with them. Toby mentioned it started to rain and Loves Truck Stop helped contain the spill from spreading more. Hazmat One arrived at Loves at 835pm to start cleaning spill. Hazmat One is renting a boom to unload trailer to clean up. They believe the leak is coming from a drum in nose of trailer. They projected a time of 600am to have spill cleaned up. Release was caused by a nail in the pallet the drums were loaded on. The nail during transit had punctured a hole in the bottom on one drum.

He notified the Mingo Yard Yardmaster who then called myself, John Vergis, Hazardous Materials Officer for the WLE.  The Yardmaster told me that the car inspector was going to get into contact with the shipper since they were just a few minutes up the road.  Randy Mitchell from Tidewater Logistics, Phone number 817-602-4898,  called to tell me that they were there looking at the car and after he described where the noise was coming from, we determined that the vacuum relief valve was defective and causing pressure to leave the tank.  They had no way of mitigating the leak so I called Specialized Professional Services out of Washington, PA to come out and look at the car.  We were not able to plug the valve because it was a flanged type device.  SPSI took thick rubber gloves and covered the valve and then secured the gloves to the valve with pipe clamps. SPSI then was in communication with the car owner so that we could confirm the proper valve that needs to go back on the car.  As of the date of this report, the car is still not repaired but we are monitoring this car daily to make sure it is no longer leaking.  This car will be repaired on site and then released into transportation.",Using a gas meter around the vacuum valve after loading would be beneficial.,No,,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,WHEELING & LAKE ERIE RAILWAY COMPANY,US,

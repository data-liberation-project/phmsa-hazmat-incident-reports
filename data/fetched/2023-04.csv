Toby notified central dispatch and they told him to contact Billy or myself. I contacted Hazmat One at 524pm and told them to make all the necessary phone calls and to take all waste with them. Toby mentioned it started to rain and Loves Truck Stop helped contain the spill from spreading more. Hazmat One arrived at Loves at 835pm to start cleaning spill. Hazmat One is renting a boom to unload trailer to clean up. They believe the leak is coming from a drum in nose of trailer. They projected a time of 600am to have spill cleaned up. Release was caused by a nail in the pallet the drums were loaded on. The nail during transit had punctured a hole in the bottom on one drum.

The released material was neutralized and collected with absorbent material. The drum was placed in an overpack awaiting disposition from the shipper. We were unable to obtain identification markings on the drum due to the material being hazardous and not wanting to tamper with the material in the overpack.,This incident may have been prevented had the employee been more aware of their fork position and surroundings. This employee was counselled and instructed per company policy.

Upon closer inspection, vapors were observed coming from a 3 bolt flange below the vapor line valve.  The bolts were checked and 2 of the 3 bolts were found to be less than tool tight.  1 of the 2 bolts was able to be tightened, the other bolt has to be changed due to deterioration from the acid.

The tote was to be positioned in a tilted position to prevent leaking out the top bung on the tote and the puncture hole on the side of the tote.  The plastic shrinkwrap that is being used to plug the puncture hole in the side of t he tote has slowed the spill from the puncture hole to a steady drip.  086 requested an immediate call for a HM cleanup team. ~~HazMat Spill Response Crew was dispatched to the location.~~NOTE: 086 had a tote from 04/06/2023, on the same shipment, that was leaking around the duct tape patch job done  by the spill team from 04/06/2023.

The released material was neutralized and collected with absorbent material. The drum was placed in an overpack awaiting disposition from the shipper. We were unable to obtain identification markings on the drum due to the material being hazardous and not wanting to tamper with the material in the overpack.,This incident may have been prevented had the employee been more aware of their fork position and surroundings.

He notified the Mingo Yard Yardmaster who then called myself, John Vergis, Hazardous Materials Officer for the WLE.  The Yardmaster told me that the car inspector was going to get into contact with the shipper since they were just a few minutes up the road.  Randy Mitchell from Tidewater Logistics, Phone number 817-602-4898,  called to tell me that they were there looking at the car and after he described where the noise was coming from, we determined that the vacuum relief valve was defective and causing pressure to leave the tank.  They had no way of mitigating the leak so I called Specialized Professional Services out of Washington, PA to come out and look at the car.  We were not able to plug the valve because it was a flanged type device.  SPSI took thick rubber gloves and covered the valve and then secured the gloves to the valve with pipe clamps. SPSI then was in communication with the car owner so that we could confirm the proper valve that needs to go back on the car.  As of the date of this report, the car is still not repaired but we are monitoring this car daily to make sure it is no longer leaking.  This car will be repaired on site and then released into transportation.",Using a gas meter around the vacuum valve after loading would be beneficial.,No,,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,WHEELING & LAKE ERIE RAILWAY COMPANY,US,

The Frontier Tank Lines truck was delivering fuel and didn't shut off due to a malfunction.  Lonestar Hazmat was dispatched to perform the cleanup. Lonestar arrived onsite and advised a 100ft-by-100ft area of asphalt was impacted by an estimated 100 gallons of diesel fuel. No storm drains or waterways were impacted. Lonestar applied absorbent material to the impacted asphalt. There was also a thin trail of diesel that migrated under about 18 parked tractor trailers but half of them did not have drivers on site.  There were a few additional puddles that were found that the contractor spread absorbents over. The crew used a pressure washer on the large area of the asphalt and the trail under the parked tractor trailers could not be cleaned properly at that time. Landstar would return once the trucks were moved. Four 55-gallon supersacks and one 330-gallon tote was generated and would be staged in New Braunfels TX, until proper disposal.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,No,,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,6000,ERTS,US,

A work area manager was questioned about the color of the diamond label (red or black and white) to determine whether the spill consisted of a corrosive or flammable liquid and what initial PPE should be donned. Management did not know and neglected to call over the radio to determine this; WAM was advised to keep an eye on the colors of hazard diamond labels in the future as it may help to expedite admin-led spill response.     After gathering spill response equipment (including 2020 ERG), three admin and one qa manager responded to spill cleanup; began blotting liquid with absorbent pads and neutralizing spill radius. DescribePack: One plastic 5 gallon pail/bucket was observed to be the source of spillage. The cap closure was not found and it is unclear whether the cap was initially loose or broke free from rough handling of Incompatible packages. V101 door typically houses trailers intended for loading of Incompatible packages. Of the 5 gallons, 4.9 gallons were released at the time of discovery. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: At the site, management advised package handlers to vacate the area temporarily. Corrosive PPE was donned, neutralizer and absorbent pads were gathered by admin. The pail/bucket was isolated in a lined open tote to negate any closed reaction or pressure build up. The UN number was identified and the 2020 ERG was consulted for UN1760 materials to review PPE required/fire/first aid measures. Admin started systemically blotting and absorbing fluid. Neutralizer was applied to the entire area and collected once reaction had subsided. Spillage and absorbent pads were collected and transferred to the HMPA.    Once neutralization and absorption was complete, admin provided the SDS for Operations Safety personnel and the contracted custodian team with Section 4 highlighted, in case exposure symptoms were observed with any contracted vendor or employee.","""NO COMMENT PROVIDED""",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Fedex Ground Package System, Inc.",US,

Upon inspection it was identified that material leaked out of an IBC and then out of the vehicle. The employees opened the box van and observed a cubic yard box (IBC) containing 118 gallon size inner containers of disinfectants was leaking. Frozen liquid was observed under the IBC and beneath the box van.  The spilled disinfectant was cleaned up and absorbent was placed within the IBC and transportation to the ultimate disposal facility was continued. In total, the IBC leaked about 3 gallons of a class 8 corrosive liquid disinfectant solution. The duration of release is anticipated to be about 48 hours and an estimated 3 gallons of disinfectant leaked.","On 4/03/2023 the Veolia safety manager was notified of the spill and performed an investigation. The results of the investigation is the inner containers in the IBC were not packaged correctly and did not have sufficient absorbent around them. Freezing temperatures caused inner glass bottles to break while the box van was parked for the weekend. The liner in the IBC also failed.

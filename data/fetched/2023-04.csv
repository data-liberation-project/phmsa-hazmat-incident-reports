Toby told me he was fueling up at the Loves at 335 LA-594, Monroe, LA, 71203 and was doing a walk around of set and noticed a pool of paint (UN1263, Paint, 3, PGIII) on ground and that it was still leaking from his rear pup (287281F). Toby notified central dispatch and they told him to contact Billy or myself. I contacted Hazmat One at 524pm and told them to make all the necessary phone calls and to take all waste with them. Toby mentioned it started to rain and Loves Truck Stop helped contain the spill from spreading more. Hazmat One arrived at Loves at 835pm to start cleaning spill. Hazmat One is renting a boom to unload trailer to clean up. They believe the leak is coming from a drum in nose of trailer. They projected a time of 600am to have spill cleaned up. Release was caused by a nail in the pallet the drums were loaded on. The nail during transit had punctured a hole in the bottom on one drum. Majority of material had leaked into the trailer",Shipper will be notified of incident and that it could have been prevented with a better inspection of pallet.,No,,,,No,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"SOUTHEASTERN FREIGHT LINES, INC.",US,

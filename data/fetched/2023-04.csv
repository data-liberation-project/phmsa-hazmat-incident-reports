Toby notified central dispatch and they told him to contact Billy or myself. I contacted Hazmat One at 524pm and told them to make all the necessary phone calls and to take all waste with them. Toby mentioned it started to rain and Loves Truck Stop helped contain the spill from spreading more. Hazmat One arrived at Loves at 835pm to start cleaning spill. Hazmat One is renting a boom to unload trailer to clean up. They believe the leak is coming from a drum in nose of trailer. They projected a time of 600am to have spill cleaned up. Release was caused by a nail in the pallet the drums were loaded on. The nail during transit had punctured a hole in the bottom on one drum.

The railcar was isolated and all departments notified.  The CN DGO responded.  Upon arrival and approaching the railcar, vapors were observed coming from the top.  Upon closer inspection, vapors were observed coming from a 3 bolt flange below the vapor line valve.  The bolts were checked and 2 of the 3 bolts were found to be less than tool tight.  1 of the 2 bolts was able to be tightened, the other bolt has to be changed due to deterioration from the acid.  Once the replacement bolts was installed and tightened, the leak was stopped.  The exterior of the railcar was decontaminated.

He notified the Mingo Yard Yardmaster who then called myself, John Vergis, Hazardous Materials Officer for the WLE.  The Yardmaster told me that the car inspector was going to get into contact with the shipper since they were just a few minutes up the road.  Randy Mitchell from Tidewater Logistics, Phone number 817-602-4898,  called to tell me that they were there looking at the car and after he described where the noise was coming from, we determined that the vacuum relief valve was defective and causing pressure to leave the tank.  They had no way of mitigating the leak so I called Specialized Professional Services out of Washington, PA to come out and look at the car.  We were not able to plug the valve because it was a flanged type device.  SPSI took thick rubber gloves and covered the valve and then secured the gloves to the valve with pipe clamps. SPSI then was in communication with the car owner so that we could confirm the proper valve that needs to go back on the car.  As of the date of this report, the car is still not repaired but we are monitoring this car daily to make sure it is no longer leaking.

The Frontier Tank Lines truck was delivering fuel and didn't shut off due to a malfunction.  Lonestar Hazmat was dispatched to perform the cleanup. Lonestar arrived onsite and advised a 100ft-by-100ft area of asphalt was impacted by an estimated 100 gallons of diesel fuel. No storm drains or waterways were impacted. Lonestar applied absorbent material to the impacted asphalt. There was also a thin trail of diesel that migrated under about 18 parked tractor trailers but half of them did not have drivers on site.  There were a few additional puddles that were found that the contractor spread absorbents over. The crew used a pressure washer on the large area of the asphalt and the trail under the parked tractor trailers could not be cleaned properly at that time. Landstar would return once the trucks were moved. Four 55-gallon supersacks and one 330-gallon tote was generated and would be staged in New Braunfels TX, until proper disposal.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,No,,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,6000,ERTS,US,

A work area manager was questioned about the color of the diamond label (red or black and white) to determine whether the spill consisted of a corrosive or flammable liquid and what initial PPE should be donned. Management did not know and neglected to call over the radio to determine this; WAM was advised to keep an eye on the colors of hazard diamond labels in the future as it may help to expedite admin-led spill response.     After gathering spill response equipment (including 2020 ERG), three admin and one qa manager responded to spill cleanup; began blotting liquid with absorbent pads and neutralizing spill radius. DescribePack: One plastic 5 gallon pail/bucket was observed to be the source of spillage. The cap closure was not found and it is unclear whether the cap was initially loose or broke free from rough handling of Incompatible packages. V101 door typically houses trailers intended for loading of Incompatible packages. Of the 5 gallons, 4.9 gallons were released at the time of discovery. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: At the site, management advised package handlers to vacate the area temporarily. Corrosive PPE was donned, neutralizer and absorbent pads were gathered by admin. The pail/bucket was isolated in a lined open tote to negate any closed reaction or pressure build up. The UN number was identified and the 2020 ERG was consulted for UN1760 materials to review PPE required/fire/first aid measures. Admin started systemically blotting and absorbing fluid. Neutralizer was applied to the entire area and collected once reaction had subsided. Spillage and absorbent pads were collected and transferred to the HMPA.    Once neutralization and absorption was complete, admin provided the SDS for Operations Safety personnel and the contracted custodian team with Section 4 highlighted, in case exposure symptoms were observed with any contracted vendor or employee.","""NO COMMENT PROVIDED""",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Fedex Ground Package System, Inc.",US,

The car was isolated and Nutrien, the shipment consignee, was notified (via CHEMTREC Report #2023-0420-00190). Hulls Environmental, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched and found 6 of 6 manway cover swing bolts less than tool tight.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to Nutrien's representative- Matt Paynter (706-564-8118). Contractor personnel also noted the manway cover gasket was not properly installed.  After ensuring proper alignment of the gasket, contractor personnel secured all 6 manway cover bolts, and the car was released for Transporation.

Package was found during the offload of an aircraft during sort operations, and it appeared to be a fibreboard box containing UN 1112, Benzene.  Initially there was no indication of leakage, however further inspection found inside the outer package there was a plastic moisture barrier.  Inside this barrier were pigmats and smaller fiberboard box which did show signs of leaking.  Box contained a bottle of Benzene which was reported the cap was loose and the contents inside were leaking. Both boxes were fully marked and labeled for DG travel although shipper's declaration did not list the shipment as an overpack.  Although the contents did not breech the outer box it was seen the inner bottle was over 1/2 empty.  shipment has been placed in a steel salvage drum and is being held pending FAA investigation.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,FedEx Express Corporation,US,

The leak occurred in a trailer that arrived from the Veolia, Kenmore, NY 10-day transfer location. The shipment was picked up by Veolia on 3/29/2023 and then driven to the Veolia, Schenectady office on 3/31/2023 and subsequently offloaded on 4/3/23. Employees opened the trailer on 4/3/23 and observed a 55 gallon drum containing flammable liquids was slowly leaking. The drum had a dent and small hole in it. Liquid was observed beneath the drum on the floor but did not leak out of the vehicle.   The drum was overpacked into an 85 gallon salvage drum, the spill cleaned up, and transportation to the ultimate disposal facility was continued. The drum leaked about 1 gallon of a class 3 flammable liquid solution. The liquid was cleaned up with spill pads and absorbent and the lid on the drum was overpacked properly to prevent it from spilling. The duration of release is anticipated to be about 3 to 5 days and an estimated 1 gallon of flammable liquids leaked. The drum was still substantially full when the leak was discovered. No material made is outside the vehicle.","On 4/03/2023 the Veolia safety manager was notified of the spill. The results of the investigation revealed the drum and small hole occurred from time it was picked up (or prior to pick up) on 3/29/23. The drum had been impacted by an object at some point. The hole was not in the area where a typical forklift strike would happen. The dent and hole were about a third of the way up the drum.  Employees are being retrained to ensure containers are inspected prior to shipping for any possible dents and leaks. Also since the origin or the damage is unknown, employees must also assure that containers are handled safely in vehicles and that nothing can impact a container while in transit.",No,,,,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

Upon inspection it was identified that material leaked out of an IBC and then out of the vehicle. The employees opened the box van and observed a cubic yard box (IBC) containing 118 gallon size inner containers of disinfectants was leaking. Frozen liquid was observed under the IBC and beneath the box van.  The spilled disinfectant was cleaned up and absorbent was placed within the IBC and transportation to the ultimate disposal facility was continued. In total, the IBC leaked about 3 gallons of a class 8 corrosive liquid disinfectant solution. The duration of release is anticipated to be about 48 hours and an estimated 3 gallons of disinfectant leaked.","On 4/03/2023 the Veolia safety manager was notified of the spill and performed an investigation. The results of the investigation is the inner containers in the IBC were not packaged correctly and did not have sufficient absorbent around them. Freezing temperatures caused inner glass bottles to break while the box van was parked for the weekend. The liner in the IBC also failed.

The driver in front of ours, also a tractor trailer, came to a sudden stop and our driver did not have time to stop before rear ending the trailer in front of them. Both drivers pulled off to the side to assess damage and swap information when our driver noticed some liquid seeping from out of the side of the trailer. The driver called the safety manager who contacted a spill clean up crew to the scene. In the meantime, the fire department and police department handled the scene and containing the minor spill. Once the crew arrived, it was determined that a group of 55 gallon drums were pushed to the nose of the trailer due to the harsh stop when rear ending the trailer in front of our driver. Multiple barrels were disformed, one was cracked near the top of the barrel and seeping the formaldehyde liquid onto the floor of the trailer and seeping through the crack of the trailer floor and wall onto the pavement for roughly three hours. By the time the barrel was sealed back up, 10 gallons were lost from the barrel, however less made its way through the crack of the trailer floor and onto pavement. Once the scene, cargo, and trailer were contained, our driver was able to proceed to the.next truck stop which was 4 miles away from the scene. We then took the trailer to the clean up crew's warehouse and they unloaded the trailer, decontaminated it, and reloaded the trailer.","Some reccomendations beyond the individual company to improve hazardous materials transportation: - officers watching speed and space management, especially for a placarded load - more focus on speed and space management for the hazmat endorcement test",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,40558,BCP TRANSPORTATION,US,

On 4/12/2023 the rail car departed the Dyno Nobel plant. The rail car was transported by the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) from Cheyenne to Saltdale, CA and made 19 stops over a 13-day journey, arriving on 4/25/2023.   While unloading the rail car, Saltdale employees discovered the center hopper was empty.  All seals were in place and unbroken.  Employees did not observe whether the bottom gate was completely closed before opening it.     On 5/11/2023, the loss was brought to the attention of Chuck Moody (Cheyenne Facilities Manager), who reported it to the National Response Center.   It appears that  an overspeed impact event while the rail car was being transported by UP caused the bottom center gate to open enough to leak the AN while in transit.  Dyno Nobel verified the car was not leaking before moving from the plant to the UP railyard in Cheyenne. On 4/12/2023, a Dyno Nobel employee also confirmed the CRDX 14235 was not leaking at the UP railyard.   Dyno Nobel inspected the loading site, interviewed the railcar loaders and track crew, and reviewed the loading procedures with those employees. Dyno Nobel also spoke to UP and the company maintaining the rail siding in Saltdale.  There are no reports or signs of any accumulation of AN at any stations or stops along the route.  Upon return to Cheyenne, the UP and FRA conducted an inspection of CRDX 14235 and found that a draft gear on a shock absorber was worn, which would prevent the rail car from absorbing energy associated with impacts in transit.  See attached documents for the railcar inspection report, the shipping papers, and the waybill.",Dyno Nobel a is conducting a root cause analysis and having an independent inspection of the rail car.  Dyno Nobel will review the loading and unloading procedures to seek areas for improvement.

The CTMV experienced a tire blow out on axle four, passenger side tire. The driver was unable to stop safely as the one lane each direction roadway contained no Improved or paved shoulder for emergency stops. Th6 driver was forced to travel approximately 1.5 miles at slow speed before the driver could safely stop at a r6adside pull out. The skldding tire overheated and ignlted with flames. After stopping, the driver used the on board fire extinguisher in attem to extinguish the fire. The flames quickly grew and ignited the product hoses stowed on the equipment tray t^t is mounted on the passenger side, below the cargo compartments. The fire/heat quickly melted through the aluminum shell of the cargo comparlments. As the compartment shells melted through, the flammable liquid ignited. The fire consumed the cargo tank motor vehicle(truck tractor/semi-trailer) and product. The Caprock volunteer fire department contained the blaze and allowed the product to be consumed by tile fire. Approximately 150 gallons of diesel fuel remained in the bottom of the compartment shell after the fire was extinguished. This product was picked up and disposed of by the local HM response vendor that was called to the scene. The vehicle wreckage was loaded onto a flatbed semi-trailer and carried away for disposal.

The car was set out at the KCS rail yard in Kansas City, MO. The Hazmat Department mobilized a rail qualified response contractor to investigate and mltigate the release. Upon arrival, responders determined that both L and R side cabinets were Ieaking, and began their response by attending to the L side cabinet. Responders opened the cabinet and determined that product was Ieaking from the liquid sample valve. The valve was found to be opened 1/3-1/2 turn, with no secondary closure applied to the end of the line. The valve was securely closed to stop the leak. The secondary closure plug was not found in the cabinet, so a 1/4"" flared cap supplied by the responders was installed tool tight to achieve a secure secondary closure. Responders then moved to the R side cabinet, and after opening it, found that product was again Ieaking from the liquid sample valve, which was open around 1/4 turn with no secondary closure plug applied. The valve was securely closed to stop the leak. Responders located the secondary closure plug inside the cabinet, and applied it tool tight. After both leaks were stopped, zip ties were reapplied to the valve handles, and the cabinets resealed. Estimated total release is 300 gallons. Once secure,the car was then released back into transportation. File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated based on the best information available at the time of filing.

Upon entering scale area the driver was instructed to move to an inspection area to complete a Level 1 inspection. During the inspection an officer noted a strong odor coming from the trailer. The doors of the trailer were opened to reveal the odor and a suspicion that there was a material leak within the load. This was deemed a non-emergency event and the driver was instructed to detach the trail6r from the truck in a cordened off area as no leak was visible inside or outside of the trailer. On April 12, 2023 US Ecology was contacted to mobilize a team to inspect the load. Prior to their arrival a fire engine was on site conducting tests to determine if it was safe to enter the trailer. US Ecology arrived on scene around 4:00 pm that afternoon to determine the origin of the smell. No leak was discovered but the totes had vented due to bulging of the totes. The crew opened the caps and vented all totes on the trailer. This caused condensation on the top of the totes which was cleaned up and the used cleaning materials were put into a 55 gallon drum and added to the load. A manifest for this drum was created to accompany the load which was then re-directed to Rineco in Benton Ark. for final disposal. ,",no comments  provided,No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"RUST & SONS TRUCKING, INC.",US,

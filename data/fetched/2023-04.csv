Toby notified central dispatch and they told him to contact Billy or myself. I contacted Hazmat One at 524pm and told them to make all the necessary phone calls and to take all waste with them. Toby mentioned it started to rain and Loves Truck Stop helped contain the spill from spreading more. Hazmat One arrived at Loves at 835pm to start cleaning spill. Hazmat One is renting a boom to unload trailer to clean up. They believe the leak is coming from a drum in nose of trailer. They projected a time of 600am to have spill cleaned up. Release was caused by a nail in the pallet the drums were loaded on. The nail during transit had punctured a hole in the bottom on one drum.

The released material was neutralized and collected with absorbent material. The drum was placed in an overpack awaiting disposition from the shipper. We were unable to obtain identification markings on the drum due to the material being hazardous and not wanting to tamper with the material in the overpack.,This incident may have been prevented had the employee been more aware of their fork position and surroundings.

He notified the Mingo Yard Yardmaster who then called myself, John Vergis, Hazardous Materials Officer for the WLE.  The Yardmaster told me that the car inspector was going to get into contact with the shipper since they were just a few minutes up the road.  Randy Mitchell from Tidewater Logistics, Phone number 817-602-4898,  called to tell me that they were there looking at the car and after he described where the noise was coming from, we determined that the vacuum relief valve was defective and causing pressure to leave the tank.  They had no way of mitigating the leak so I called Specialized Professional Services out of Washington, PA to come out and look at the car.  We were not able to plug the valve because it was a flanged type device.  SPSI took thick rubber gloves and covered the valve and then secured the gloves to the valve with pipe clamps. SPSI then was in communication with the car owner so that we could confirm the proper valve that needs to go back on the car.  As of the date of this report, the car is still not repaired but we are monitoring this car daily to make sure it is no longer leaking.  This car will be repaired on site and then released into transportation.",Using a gas meter around the vacuum valve after loading would be beneficial.,No,,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,WHEELING & LAKE ERIE RAILWAY COMPANY,US,

Once we inspected the package we noticed 1 of the 3 bottles was leaking. All 3 caps were loose and the one bottle that was leaking had a paper seal that was torn which led to the wet spot on the package. It also appeared that the package could have been dropped. The leak contaminated all 3 bottles. DescribePack: Loose caps on all 3 bottles but only 1 leaked. The paper seal on the leaking bottle had a 1/8 inch hole/crack in the top of the seal. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: We responded quickly to the radio call of a potential hazmat leaking package.

The Frontier Tank Lines truck was delivering fuel and didn't shut off due to a malfunction.  Lonestar Hazmat was dispatched to perform the cleanup. Lonestar arrived onsite and advised a 100ft-by-100ft area of asphalt was impacted by an estimated 100 gallons of diesel fuel. No storm drains or waterways were impacted. Lonestar applied absorbent material to the impacted asphalt. There was also a thin trail of diesel that migrated under about 18 parked tractor trailers but half of them did not have drivers on site.  There were a few additional puddles that were found that the contractor spread absorbents over. The crew used a pressure washer on the large area of the asphalt and the trail under the parked tractor trailers could not be cleaned properly at that time. Landstar would return once the trucks were moved.

A work area manager was questioned about the color of the diamond label (red or black and white) to determine whether the spill consisted of a corrosive or flammable liquid and what initial PPE should be donned. Management did not know and neglected to call over the radio to determine this; WAM was advised to keep an eye on the colors of hazard diamond labels in the future as it may help to expedite admin-led spill response.     After gathering spill response equipment (including 2020 ERG), three admin and one qa manager responded to spill cleanup; began blotting liquid with absorbent pads and neutralizing spill radius. DescribePack: One plastic 5 gallon pail/bucket was observed to be the source of spillage. The cap closure was not found and it is unclear whether the cap was initially loose or broke free from rough handling of Incompatible packages. V101 door typically houses trailers intended for loading of Incompatible packages. Of the 5 gallons, 4.9 gallons were released at the time of discovery. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: At the site, management advised package handlers to vacate the area temporarily. Corrosive PPE was donned, neutralizer and absorbent pads were gathered by admin. The pail/bucket was isolated in a lined open tote to negate any closed reaction or pressure build up. The UN number was identified and the 2020 ERG was consulted for UN1760 materials to review PPE required/fire/first aid measures. Admin started systemically blotting and absorbing fluid. Neutralizer was applied to the entire area and collected once reaction had subsided. Spillage and absorbent pads were collected and transferred to the HMPA.    Once neutralization and absorption was complete, admin provided the SDS for Operations Safety personnel and the contracted custodian team with Section 4 highlighted, in case exposure symptoms were observed with any contracted vendor or employee.","""NO COMMENT PROVIDED""",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Fedex Ground Package System, Inc.",US,

During this time, it was discovered that two employees, Darrius Cozart and Jeremy Murray, had come in contact with the hazmat. Robert immediately instructed Darrius and Jeremy to rinse hands under water. Robert then placed damaged hazmat in bag + tote and promptly removed the package from the work area. He then communicated incident to ops admins, Emil Wisch (myself) and Keeli Palmateer.     Emil & Keeli instantly moved to location to assess the incident. There was a small amount of the hazmat spilled in drops under the line/rollers between work areas 216 and 236. There were two places where the spill was more concentrated (one was roughly an area of 10"" X 2"" and the other roughly 14"" x 2""). Emil instructed nearby managers, package handlers, BCs and drivers to stay clear of the area and left to retrieve PPE and cleanup materials while Keeli researched first aid response for Darrius and Jeremy. She echoed Robert's instructions of running contact areas under water (adding the details running under COLD water for 15 MINUTES).    Darrius and Jeremy were moved to the office where Senior Manager, Nancy Morris and P&D Manager, Patryk Rojewski took over first aid.    Emil returned and spread AMPHOMAG neutralizer on spill locations while Keeli observed (training).    It was later discovered that the spill had actually originated in a trailer in the unload. It is unknown how the damage to the package occurred. There were no reports of any injuries to any employees who were near that trailer at the time the package was unloaded. Emil and Keeli moved to the location where the spill had originated. Emil spread AMPHOMAG neutralizer on all visible locations of the spilled hazmat while Keeli observed (training).    Emil and Keeli later returned to both locations where the neutralizer was spread and collected all materials in hazmat bags and totes.    There are no known complications to employees, Darrius Cozart or Jeremy Murray, proceeding the incident up to the time of this report. Both reported to work the following day with no known restrictions. DescribePack: There was a large hole/tear in the outer container of the package. Inside the package were 4 x 1 gallon plastic bottles of hazmat. Each bottle was contained in a plastic bag. One of those bottles' caps was unfastened. No damage DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: 1 hour is overestimating. I believe the release was less than 30 minutes (in our facility, station 610). Response was timely and well-coordinated. Mitigation included prompt first-aid to 2 affected employees, near-instant containment of damaged package allowing no future release and neutralization of acid to prevent any further damage to people, package and facility.",NO COMMENT PROVIDED,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box,4G,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Fedex Ground Package System, Inc.",US,

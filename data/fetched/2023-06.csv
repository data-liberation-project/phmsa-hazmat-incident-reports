During this time, it was discovered that two employees, Darrius Cozart and Jeremy Murray, had come in contact with the hazmat. Robert immediately instructed Darrius and Jeremy to rinse hands under water. Robert then placed damaged hazmat in bag + tote and promptly removed the package from the work area. He then communicated incident to ops admins, Emil Wisch (myself) and Keeli Palmateer.     Emil & Keeli instantly moved to location to assess the incident. There was a small amount of the hazmat spilled in drops under the line/rollers between work areas 216 and 236. There were two places where the spill was more concentrated (one was roughly an area of 10"" X 2"" and the other roughly 14"" x 2""). Emil instructed nearby managers, package handlers, BCs and drivers to stay clear of the area and left to retrieve PPE and cleanup materials while Keeli researched first aid response for Darrius and Jeremy. She echoed Robert's instructions of running contact areas under water (adding the details running under COLD water for 15 MINUTES).    Darrius and Jeremy were moved to the office where Senior Manager, Nancy Morris and P&D Manager, Patryk Rojewski took over first aid.    Emil returned and spread AMPHOMAG neutralizer on spill locations while Keeli observed (training).    It was later discovered that the spill had actually originated in a trailer in the unload. It is unknown how the damage to the package occurred. There were no reports of any injuries to any employees who were near that trailer at the time the package was unloaded. Emil and Keeli moved to the location where the spill had originated. Emil spread AMPHOMAG neutralizer on all visible locations of the spilled hazmat while Keeli observed (training).    Emil and Keeli later returned to both locations where the neutralizer was spread and collected all materials in hazmat bags and totes.    There are no known complications to employees, Darrius Cozart or Jeremy Murray, proceeding the incident up to the time of this report. Both reported to work the following day with no known restrictions. DescribePack: There was a large hole/tear in the outer container of the package. Inside the package were 4 x 1 gallon plastic bottles of hazmat. Each bottle was contained in a plastic bag. One of those bottles' caps was unfastened. No damage DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: 1 hour is overestimating. I believe the release was less than 30 minutes (in our facility, station 610). Response was timely and well-coordinated.

CN Dangerous Goods Officer upon arrival and inspection found the bottom outlet valve cap to be less than tool tight and the bottom outlet valve handle to not be in the fully closed position, allowing product to enter the cap and leak out.  The bottom outlet valve was moved to the fully closed position. The BOV cap was then removed and observed for 20 minutes to ensure there was no further leakage from the valve. The bottom outlet valve cap was then re-installed and tightened with a 36"" pipe wrench.

Upon inspection the employee identified that a material leaked out of the pail because there was no vermiculite in the pail as required for a proper lab pack. One of the inner containers of hydrogen peroxide leaked when it fell over and then leaked out of the outer container. About 100 milliters of hydrogen peroxide leaked out of the container.   The spill was cleaned up and absorbent was placed within the pail and transportation to the ultimate disposal facility was continued. The pail leaked about 100 milliters of a class 5.1(8) Oxidizing, corrosive liquid hydrogen peroxide solution. The liquid was cleaned up with absorbent and absorbent was added to the pail as required. The duration of release was less than 1 minute.",On 6/02/2023 the Veolia safety manager was notified of the spill.

The driver entered the corner at excessive speed, and immediately before the corner struck a large pothole in the road, which apparently caused two trailer tires to blow out, contributing to the loss of control in the corner.  The tractor trailer combination rolled onto its side and departed the roadway, coming to rest beside and below the highway grade.  The driver received only minor injuries and did not require transport for medical attention.  At the time of the initial response, Alaska Commercial Vehicle Compliance and Alaska State Troopers believed there may have been a release due to the odor, however Suburban Propane (shipper) personnel arrived on the scene and reported there was no leak beyond normal vent operation.  Personnel and equipment were mobilized to the scene, the product was transloaded into another tanker, and a wrecker removed the tractor and trailer and brought them back to Fairbanks.  Professional traffic control allowed this to be completed without requiring a road closure.","In training for commercial drivers, emphasize the handling effects of cargo tanks and other top-heavy loads, and the propensity for rollovers.  A lot of training material on this subject emphasizes slowing down on highway on and off ramps; while nationwide this is probably the greatest exposure for cargo tank rollovers, the way the topic is presented may not resonate as well with drivers on rural and mountain roads who face the same challenges in terms of road geometry and the need to properly manage their speed.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,70000,"WEAVER BROS., INC.",US,

The leak occurred when the employee was loading drums into the trailer and the employee misjudged how close the pallet was to the drums that were already in the trailer for shipment. The 55 gallon drum containing flammable liquids was mostly dented but a small crease caused a leak from the drum and about a liter leaked out of the impacted drum. Liquid was only observed on trailer right below drum and did not leak out of the vehicle.   The drum was overpacked into an 85 gallon salvage drum, the spill cleaned up, and transportation to the ultimate disposal facility was continued. The drum leaked about 1 liter of a class 3 flammable liquid solution. The liquid was cleaned up with spill pads and absorbent and the lid on the drum was overpacked properly to prevent it from spilling. The duration of release is anticipated to be less than 1 minute as the employee noticed the accident right away and an estimated 1 liter of flammable liquids leaked.",On 6/20/2023 the Veolia safety manager was notified of the spill. The results of the investigation is the employee misjudged the distance from the corner of the pallet to the nearby drum that was hit. The employee was removed from the forklift and retrained.

As a result of the accident, non-regulated “FM-9058 IBCQ” and UN1263 “Thermo Sorb VOC” released impacting the asphalt and soil shoulder as well as into the ditch. No storm drains or waterways were impacted by the release. At 1120 ET, XPO Logistics retained Emergency Response and Training Solutions (ERTS) to manage and oversee the above referenced incident. ARTG Environmental was secured to perform all onsite cleanup and remediation activities. At 1315 ET, ARTG personnel arrived onsite to conduct an initial site assessment. Billy’s Wrecker service was also onsite and towed the damaged unit along with the damaged cargo to their yard. ARTG secured the impacted soil and roadside area with boom and departed site to head to the wrecker yard. Once the contractors arrived at the wrecker yard, poly sheeting was utilized to secure the damaged trailer while awaiting the arrival of a relief trailer. The crew departed site for the day.  On June 20 and 21, 2023, ARTG personnel returned to the spill site to complete the excavation. The crew advised the product released had traveled down and embankment in 10” tall grass but did not reach a nearby creek which was approximately 15’ away. The crew dug approximately 1’ deep into the ditch due to woodchip material being in the ditch, allowing for a more porous surface. The impacted shoulder measured approximately 250' x 4' leading into a slope measuring approximately 60' x 30' which led into the ditch in an 80' x 6' area. A total of approximately 270-tons of impacted soil was excavated and staged roadside, secured with poly sheeting awaiting disposal.   On June 23, 2023, ARTG returned to the tow yard to complete the trailer cleanout. All unimpacted freight was offloaded into a relief trailer. The contractors were able to confirm during this cleanup what material was released to the roadside. Approximately 500-gallons of non-regulated FM-9058 released from (2) 275-gallon poly totes as well as approximately 40-gallons of UN1263 “Thermo-Sorb VOC” released from (8) 5-gallon metal pails. The damaged pails of paint were containerized into (2) 55-gallon metal drums which were transported to the XPO terminal located 6101 Lindsey Rd, Little Rock, AR 72206, for terminal personnel to manage. The two totes are staged at ARTG’s shop pending disposal.  On July 11, 2023, ARTG returned to the site to take confirmation samples for site closure, lab results are still pending.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,35000,ERTS,US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, West Virginia DEP, and National Response Center were notified.  (CHEMTREC Report #2023-0623-00192). Specialized Professional Services, Inc, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the reclosing pressure relief device stuck in the open position that resulted in the release of lading while the car was in motion. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative, Ms. Judy Watson of Valero Marketing, phone (210) 241-2886, email judy.watson@valero.com. Contractor personnel manually reset the pressure relief device. The contents of the car were transloaded without incident, and the car will move to a shop of the car owner's choice with an OTMA-1 per 49 CFR 174.50. (FRA assigned Investigators have been updated) The leak was secured and the car was released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move. 7.1 is required.

The batteries looked to be secured to the pallets and the pallets looked to be in good, sturdy condition. The driver traveled about 2 miles down the road to a stop light. While pulling away from the light he heard a bang coming from his trailer. He pulled over as soon as he found a safe place to do so along a ramp going onto the Turnpike. When he opened the trailer to check the load he saw that one of the batteries had fallen over due to a pallet collapsing. THere was no harsh braking, acceleration or cornering events to trigger the spill. He then checked the rest of the load and saw that there were other pallets that were not looking as stable as they should be. The driver did have some soda ash on his truck which he used to soak up, neutralize and berm as much of the spilled acid as he could. He did call back to Corporate for help with the clean up. The police showed up to the scene. After assessing the spill and seeing that the trailer is no longer leaking the police assisted the driver to tum his truck around and off the Turnpike ramp for easier assistance for clean up. The Hazmat clean up team arrived shorlty after the turnaround. While wating for the Hazmat clean up team, the driver contacted the cutomer that he picked up the batteries from since they were a few miles down the road asking if they would take back his load and help up-right the battery that had spilled. They accepted. The police gave the driver permission to drive back to the custmer with the Hazmat clean up team following to make sure that nothing leaked from the trailer during transit. Nothing leaked during the move. The police informed the driver that they will have the trunpike maintenacne clean up the spilled area on the ramp. Once back at the cusomer, the customer unloaded the load and helped to up-right the spilled battery. They are going to re-palletize ALL the batteries and put them on better/ stronger pallets for a future pick up. The Hazmat team cleaned out the trailer and will take care of the clean up waste. Once the trailer was cleaned the driver returned home with an",- The driver was re-trained on packaging and securing used Industrial Motive Power Batteries.

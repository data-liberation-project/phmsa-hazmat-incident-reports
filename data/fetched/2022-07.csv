The railcar departed Cheyenne on 6/21/2022 and was delivered to industry at Tooele, UT site on 6/28/2022. The railcar was transported by the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) from Cheyenne, WY to Tooele, UT and made five stops for transfer to other trains over the eight-day journey. The car remained at the Rocky Mountain Rail Repair rail siting until 7/6//2022, when it was moved to the Savage Services transloading site for offloading. Savage Services noted that all seals were present with the exception of the one for the center bottom gate.  The Savage employees noted a steel cable was clipped to the hasp instead of a seal. Savage employees did not inspect further and began offloading the AN.  The Savage employees subsequently discovered the railcar was missing 40,581 lbs. of AN and notified Dyno Nobel.    Dyno Nobel notified FRA inspector Jerome Sedillo who advised to notify the NRC.  Dyno Nobel notified the Savage Services Ops Manager that he needed to report the incident to the NRC since he was in possession of the railcar and its material.  Dyno Nobel contacted the UP and advised them of the incident to inspect their railyards and tracks for evidence of AN.  On 7/7/2022, Dyno Nobel was informed that Savage Services did not make the report, so Dyno Nobel contacted the NRC.     Savage, Rocky Mountain, and the UP did not locate evidence of AN in their railyards or along the tracks.  The Cheyenne loading site also inspected their site and did not find evidence of AN on the tracks.  On 7/10/2022, Rocky Mountain inspected the railcar and found the center gravity gate had a worn-out drive bar, and the pinion was not engaging the door rack.  The inspector stated this will allow the door to move easily and would not permit it to completely close when loaded.  During transit, it appears the bottom gate opened and spilled AN, which dispersed along the route within the railroad tracks.  It also appears someone may have discovered it and attempted to secure the gate using the steel cable, but no one reported it.  In the event the UP locates AN prill along the rail line or in any of the UP yards, Dyno Nobel will coordinate with them to recover and clean up the prill by hiring a hazardous materials contractor.   Dyno Nobel inspected their loading site, interviewed the railcar loaders and track crew, and reviewed the loading procedures with those employees.   See attached documents for the detailed timeline of the incident, the railcar inspection report, and the shipping papers.    There are two areas in this report, which require additional explanation.    One area is the validation message that states: “Questions #3 and #7 - The Incident Date and Location do not match the date and location in the master NRC database for NRC number: 1340861.

MGR., TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE",1 EDEN LN,FLANDERS,NJ,07836-8950,Facility,On 7/8/2022 Veolia employees from the West Virginia office picked up a load of containers from a customers site. The majority of the shipment was 55 gallon drums of flammable paint. The drums were loaded 4 to a pallet and were then loaded onto Veolia's truck with no issue. Upon return to Veolia's West Virginia officer the Veolia driver attempted to offload the box truck using a seated forklift. As he was driving over the dock plate that leads into the warehouse one of the drums that was loaded on the pallet he was carrying tilted forward and fell off the pallet. The drum fell to the floor of the truck and the lid popped up when it hit the ground leading to the release of white paint. The paint was contained inside the truck using spill dry and absorbent pads. Following the incident Veolia employees inspected both the pallet and the 55 gallon drum. It was discovered that the pallet was missing several boards which made it unstable. When then employee drove over the dock plate the bump and incline allowed the drum to tip into the gap left from the broken pallet and fall forward to the ground. When the drum hit the ground the lid folded up allowing the liquid to leak from the container. The time of the release was less than a minute. Our employee was able to quickly pick up the container to prevent further leakage after the event occurred. All spill debris was properly cleaned up and placed inside a spill clean up drum for proper disposal.,Veolia's EHS Manager we will be meeting with the West Virginia team on 7/15/2022 to discuss this incident. The focus of that conversation will center around checking pallets and containers before taking possession of the container at the customer's site. Veolia should never accept a container or a pallet that is in poor condition. We will also discuss the importance slowing down and taking extra caution when driving over a dock plate. When driving over a dock plate employees need to understand that they will be backing over a bump and that bump will also put them at a slight downward incline. This presents an perfect opportunity for a drum to tip or slide so they need to account for that while they are driving into the warehouse.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The driver was not allowed on the dock during loading and when she went in the cargo box to secure the freight there were no hazmat markings or labels visible.   When the freight delivered on 07/14/2022, the driver was on the dock area while the freight was offloaded and saw that there were hazmat markings and labels on the freight. She further noticed that all remaining freight in the cargo box was loaded so that the side with the hazmat markings and labels loaded to be facing the sidewalls of the cargo box which would prevent her from seeing the hazmat details. She took photos of the freight and those were escalated to me in the Safety department.  The shipment was booked as non-hazardous, so I contacted the shipper to see if there was some special exemption that allowed the freight to move without shipping paperwork since I did not see any that applied to the proper shipping name that appeared on the freight. The shipper instead provided me with a copy of the shipper's declaration of dangerous goods that should have accompanied the shipment during transportation.","I entered a location code note that all 4 sides of the cargo must be viewed prior to loading to verify no hazmat markings or labels were present based on this issue, despite the shipper's policy that we our drivers are not allowed on the dock during loading.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"FEDEX CUSTOM CRITICAL, INC.",US,

No storm drains or waterways are reported to be impacted by the release. ERTS dispatched an environmental contractor who arrived on site and estimated that approximately 125 gallons released to the trailer floor and adjacent asphalt parking lot. First responders had placed containment to secure the release. The contractor offloaded the leaking IBC and transferred the remaining product into a field supplied IBC. The contractor also conducted addiitonal product transferred from several damaged (but not leaking) IBCs.

Following contractor arrival and visual assessment, it was concluded based on this assessment and discussion with a ChampionX representative on site that the driver left the ChampionX facility and at some point, had to apply his brakes very abruptly causing the load to shift forward. The strap holding the tote appeared to have bent the cage surrounding the tote which then punctured the plastic part of the tote causing the release. Driver then turned around and went back to the ChampionX facility where the product leaked onto their parking lot.  A 25' by 15' area of the concrete was impacted and a 6' by 6' area of dirt was impacted. The totes were offloaded and the trailer was wiped down with chemical pads. Allied transferred approximately 210 gallons of product into a new 230 gallon poly tote which ChampionX has deemed as waste. The tote will be staged onsite until Allied can return to pick up the tote for disposal. Absorbents were worked in and recovered and the impacted dirt was collected.

We advised ATC, cleared the runway to make contact with SOC and coordinate a return to gate. Maintenance met the plane and the TCB with the cell phone was removed from the plane. While waiting for a replacement TCB, I worked with UA gate staff to make sure the passenger understood the process. Upon completion of the maintenance procedures we departed without any further incident.  Flight Attendant 1 Statement: We were on the runway in line for take off, I was in my jump seat and noticed smoke coming out of a cell phone. Pax was in 1C. Her child had been playing with the phone. the Mom and i noticed the smoke at the same time. I jumped out of my seat grabbed the phone, threw it in the galley, Called the Capitan, and checked for heat on the the phone. I happed so fast I am not sure the order in which this happened. Once I was satisfied that the phone was not hot, I placed the phone and the charger in the red Thermal bag and zipped it. The PAX was upset and insisted that it was the outlet and not the phone, I felt the out let it was cool. I personally saw smoke coming out of the bottom of the phone. We went back to the gate and the CA handled the situation from there. the lady wanted her phone back but the CA would not allow it back on the plane (thank Goodness).  Flight Attendant 2 Statement: Pilot was literally about to take off when FA1 Janey saw smoke in the air. She immediately called Pilot to inform him to not take off then proceeded to get out of jumpseat and assist 1C. She was not sure if it was the charger, phone, or outlet so she put the items in the TCB. Once we went back to the gate, Mesa MTC came on board as well as gate agents. finally, we were told to leave the items behind while the passenger insisted that she wanted her phone back.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,US,

The exact amount of oil released is not able to be determined, but is estimated to be between 1 quart and 1 gallon of oil. The estimate is based on the level of oil remaining in the transformer. The release was from splashing out of the top of the transformer during transportation. The transformer did not have a gasket seal in place and the top was loose with the restraining bolt only lightly tightened, this allowed oil to splash up and over the transformer. PCB oil concentration is 104 PPM. Contacted surfaces and media are: metal ramp and fiberglass wall of the trailer, a pallet jack in the trailer, wood floor planking in the trailer, and water that had accumulated in the loading dock well from a recent rain. Water collected from dock well for disposal as PCB contaminated water, wood form the immediate spill  will be removed from floor of trailer for disposal as PCB debris, metal pallet jack decontaminated with kerosene, wheels of pallet jack replaced, metal flooring and inside wall of trailer decontaminated with kerosene.","To prevent a reoccurence, Veolia is implementing the following safety measures: Verify that all covers are properly secured before attempting to load or transport; Place transformers that contain liquids into secondary containment or drain before shipment; Use metal floor trailers when feasible for shipment of transformers; and Retrain employees as necessary",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

He is former QA and has held/has certification. There was a Hazmat that spilled on the Silver Belt by Door 603 during the Sunrise sort. It was determined that the Hazmat in question was a Toxic Flammable Liquid known as Pyridine, confirmed via the OP-950 on the package and strong fish like odor associated with the chemical. I called the emergency contact number and got a hold of Ron with Chemtec on proper clean-up process. The process that he instructed us to do was to put some form of absorbent on the spill and keep the area well ventilated, which Noelia and I did immediately following the spill. We removed the trailers from the dock in order to better ventilate the area. Once the spill has been completely absorbed, we are to use rubber gloves and eye protection to scoop up the absorbent and we are to use a plastic shovel to avoid any possibilities of creating sparks. It was advised an Emergency Response Team was not necessary for the situation given we followed the proper procedures immediately following the spill.

The car was isolated and the shipper, National Response Center, and Ohio EPA were notified.  (CHEMTREC Report #2022-0803-00215). Joseph Taylor and Ryan Godsey, CSX Managers of Hazardous Materials were dispatched to the scene and discovered the liquid eduction line primary closure flange was improperly secured - 1 of 4 securement studs were observed with one missing securement nut. Additionally, it was determined a contributing factor to the release of lading was due to pressure in the outage / vapor space that resulted in material elevating through the liquid eduction line and past the improperly secured closure. The CSX Managers relieved the vapor pressure by opening the vapor valve and the release was immediately stopped, to which the primary closure was then secured.  Enviroserve, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and assisted with the cleanup of all spilled material to the ground, and decontaminated all exterior surfaces of the car from residue lading. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Mr. Doug Nestler of Univar Solutions, phone (408) 221-4964. Because of the significance of the release, an approved Mobile Repair Unit will replace all studs on the liquid line primary closure before the car is released to continue in transportation.

The Car Shop was instructed to remove the car for them shop and to spot the car so responders could investigate the odor. A railroad qualified response contractor was mobilized to investigate and mitigate the release. Upon arrival, responders found no visible signs of release after opening the protective housing. With the use of a Multi-Rae 4.Gas PID air monitor, the leak was detected at the sample valve end plug. Responders found the sample valve and the sample valve end plug were both less than tool tight. With the use of a wrench, the the sample valve and the sample valve end plug were rendered tool tight. After approximately a 20-minute wait time, the closures were checked again with the Multi-Rae meter to assure that the leak was secured. The Multi-Rae meter reading was non-detect. In addition, olfactory senses could not detect an odor. Estimated release was one quart.

The driver contacted emergency response for trailer investigation and clean up. Emergency response arrived and entered the trailer. A long stain was discovered along the floor of the trailer. The stain appeared to have been released from a 55-gallon drum with stains around the bung, but no evidence of an active leak was discovered.

The car was isolated and Polychemie Inc were notified (CHEMTREC Report #2022070500053). E3 Environmental, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found that vapors were being released from both liquid line valves and vapor line valves.  All three valves were not in the closed position and all three secondary closure plugs were found to be less than tool tight. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Stacy Hamlin at 912-432-5220. Contractor personnel closed all the valves and properly tool tightened all three secondary closure plugs. The leak was secured and the car will require an OTMA 1 to be sent to home shop for inspection of valves and closures. This incident did require a special switching move.

                &lt;li&gt;Description: Clean Harbors was dispatched to the site. Upon the contractorâ€™s arrival, they observed an estimated (150) gallons of material released from one (1) 330-gallon plastic tote punctured by a forklift. Clean Harbors personnel observed that the released material impacted 30 ft-by-30 ft area of dock floor concrete. Clean Harbors personnel deployed granular absorbents to the impacted area and containerized them into three (3) 55-gallon poly drums. The remaining material in the product tote was to be transferred to a new 330-gallon IBC tote. However, both pumps cleaned harbors brought were faulty. They had obtained a functional pump from a local supplier and began pumping out the material. Work was paused to obtain upgraded PPE. After obtaining the correct PPE, personnel were able to complete the tote transfer. The incident generated a total of six (6) containers. One (1) 55-gallon poly drum contains two (2) 330-gallon poly tote bladders (cut up), Poly sheeting, and PPE. One (1) 55-gallon poly drum contains a diaphragm pump rinse water. One (1) 330-gallon tote contains the original product. Three (3) 55-gallon poly drums contain absorbent debris. The generated waste was staged onsite at the terminal prior to the contractor demobilization. The generated waste will remain onsite for the ESTES DGRM team to coordinate disposal.&lt;/li&gt;

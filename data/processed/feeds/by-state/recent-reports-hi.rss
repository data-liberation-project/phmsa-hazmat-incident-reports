                &lt;li&gt;Description: On Friday, 11/15/2024, a shipper attempted to ship undeclared dangerous goods. The shipper, Onesource Distributors, attempted to ship the same product twice on the same day. He went to two different employees and the shipment was rejected each time. Attempt#1 Shipper arrived at approx. 0912 carrying two boxes with limited quantity labels. Our Crew Chief noticed the label and questioned the shipper. Our employee looked up the SDS sheet online, seen it was a dangerous goods product and rejected the shipment. Attempt#2 The same driver came back at approximately 1403 with a different package. Our Cargo Agent helped him and created the air waybill to accept the shipment. However, our Crew Chief who handled the first attempt noticed the same driver. She had the accepting CargoÂ·Agent open the package to inspect it and found that it was the same product however it was not in the original package. The shipper took everything out of the original packages and put it in one different package. The shipment was then rejected again. It was also noted that there was no DG placard displayed on the vehicle this product was transported in by highway. Pictures and screenshots will be submitted.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

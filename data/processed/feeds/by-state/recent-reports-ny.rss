                &lt;li&gt;Description: While boarding flight 149 JFK to GND. The FO and CA were waiting for refueling to be completed before doing the before start checked to the line. The F3, came in the cockpit and said there was a “medical issue” he then corrected and said ”safety issue in the jetway”. The CA was walking into the galley was told it was a bag fire in the jetway.  When he stepped into the jetway, he observed a wet bag, 2 empty water bottles, and fire extinguisher, next to an open bag.  It had a  blue battery disconnected from the bag. The F1 was watching over it with fire gloves. The CA then asked all in the jetway (starting to get crowded) if fire rescue was notified and was told ops knows about it. He immediately went into the cockpit and called ground operations to let them know they were had a bag fire in the jetway that appeared to be out. He also mentioned that he believed ops had informed Port authority but would confirm. He called OPS on the radio and they knew. He asked them to call the Port Authority to have the bag looked at. They said they would.  On his way back to the jetway he noticed all the customers were in their seats he checked on the bag. No fire and then made a PA to let the customers know all was safe and what had happened.  After things settled down it became clear to me what an amazing job the Flight attendants did. The F1 said she observed the customer walking down the jetway rolling a smoking bag. She stoped the customer prevented the bag from getting on the aircraft and called for safety team on the PA. She and the team went into action and by the time I got to the jetway, they had the fire out the battery cooled with water and the customers in their seats. Obviously the aircraft passageway was initially clogged with bags customers etc. that was cleared and the F3 got to the cockpit to let us know about the issue. I can’t say enough about how well the flight attendants did.   The suitcase was found to contain a medical refrigerator, manufactured by North Sciences.  The battery connected to the refrigerator was a 120 wH, Lithium Ion Battery.  It&amp;#x27;s only markings were as follows: Stirling Engine Li-ion Battery Model: JCB2405A Rated: 24V-5000mAh-120Wh Date: 2021-7 All other markings were in foreign language.  The bag also contained a Power Supply Unit, manufacturer unknown.  It had a Lithium Ion battery rated at 257.52 Wh.  It did not go into thermal runaway and did not contribute to the event.  Both items were confiscated and placed on internal reports DGR53-24 (battery) and DGR64-24 (Power Supply).&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: On 01/04/2024, at 1336 hours, personnel at the CSX yard in Selkirk, New York, reported product leaking from inside the valve box of car LTCX 1902, a tank car loaded with Argon, refrigerated liquid.  The car was isolated and the shipper, Linde Inc., was notified via CHEMTREC (Report 2024-0104-00121). David Scoons, a CSX Senior Manager of Hazardous Materials, responded to the incident and determined the cause of the release was a loose coupler fitting on a gauge panel feed line.  Response personnel tightened the loose coupler fitting and stopped the release.  The shipper’s representative, Timothy Lavallee (716-225-0242), was notified of the condition found and the corrective actions taken.&lt;/li&gt;

R+L Carriers retained Cura Emergency Services, LC who dispatched a crew from EnviroServe (ES) to remediate the impacted site. ES personnel deployed soda ash and absorbent pads to the sodium hydroxide-impacted trailer interior and swept them in with hand tools. All spent absorbents and impacted cardboard were collected and containerized into one (1) 35-gallon drum. An additional 35-gallon drum was used to contain the damaged 1-gallon jugs and both were set aside for terminal disposal.&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: On December 19, 2023, at 0711 ET, Emergency Response and Training Solutions (ERTS) was contacted by A Duie Pile personnel in Newburgh, NY regarding the release of an unknown amount of various products due to a multiple vehicle accident (The speed of the vehicle is unknown). Contractors were dispatched to the site to perform all onsite clean-up activities. Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of multiple materials which included KEM AQUA® 400 Waterborne Enamel (UN1263, 3, III), Polane Plus Enamel (Part A) (UN1263, 3, III), and a Flammable Liquid, Corrosive, n.o.s. (UN1263, 3, II). Contractors were unable to assess approximately how much of each were released due to the materials mixing with each other. Contractors were able to clean the release with absorbents and the proper PPE. All waste generated was containerized in (7) 55-gallon poly drum, and (7) 55-gallon metal drum which was then taken offsite by contractors for proper disposal.&lt;/li&gt;

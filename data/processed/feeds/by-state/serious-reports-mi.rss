                &lt;li&gt;Description: Driver was traveling north bound on I-75 north of Flint, MI when he was pulled over by Michigan State Police at 16:15 ET for a lane restriction violation. Upon inspection of the tractor/trailer, the trooper detected a leak coming out from under the ss skin on the bottom of the trailer just in front of the rollover protection. A tub was placed underneath the leak to contain it until the cleanup crew from Michigan Spill Response arrived on scene. After a short period of time, the leak stopped and there was only residue on the trailer. At that time, the top of the trailer was visually inspected and right above the area of the leak, there was a 3&amp;quot; washout cap that had fresh residue in the area which indicated that it had leaked. When Michigan Spill Response arrived on scene, they went to the top of the trailer and determined that the front washout cap was loose. They removed the washout cap, inspected the gasket, and then secured the washout cap to the threaded connection. After replacing the cap, a surge test was conducted on site and the trailer showed no signs of of any further leakage. Michigan Spill Response cleaned the residue from the trailer and disposed of the product that was collected in the catch pan placed underneath the trailer. Once the residue was removed rom the trailer, the load continued on without further incident. L&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: Tank car GATX 109865 was reported to be leaking with visible vapor release and icing on the protective housing while in the BNSF Everett Delta yard.  The car was isolated and responders were mobilized to inspect.  Upon inspection, it was found that the sample line valve was cracked near the threads to the sample line nipple.  A Midland kit was installed to control the release.  GATX 109865 was transferred to the FURX 130095.  The cracked sample valve was removed from the car and a cap installed to secure the car for movement under an OTMA to shop for repairs.  Release estimates are based upon evaluation of outage at the time of the response in comparison to original outage.  All released Butane dissipated to atmosphere.&lt;/li&gt;

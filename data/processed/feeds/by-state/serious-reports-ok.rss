                &lt;li&gt;Description: On October 5, 2024, at approximately 12:30 p.m in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma, a Plains transport driver with a load of crude oil traveling westbound on Oklahoma Highway 47 departed the roadway. The driver attempted to re-enter the roadway, causing both truck and cargo to roll 1 1/4 times before reentering the roadway where it overturned. The driver was found deceased on the scene.  Upon investigation, the front ladder of the cargo trailer had punctured a hole in the trailer at the 7 o&amp;#x27;clock position (11 o&amp;#x27;clock position upright). As a result of the rollover, approximately 140 barrels of crude oil were released into the dry roadside ditch. The vehicle was removed from the scene, and impacted soils were excavated and removed in accordance with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission Oil &amp;amp; Gas Division clean-up criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

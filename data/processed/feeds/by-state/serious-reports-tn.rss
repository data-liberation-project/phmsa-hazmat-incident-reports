                &lt;li&gt;Description: At approximately 11 :00 am ET on December 11, PETNET Knoxville-UT was notified that an MDS courier transporting three PETNET cases containing live patient doses had been involved in a single-vehicle rollover accident on eastbound Interstate 40 near mile marker 424. The bills of lading for those packages are in Attachment 1. The cases contained a total of five patient doses with a combined activity of approximately 210 mCi of Flourine-18 at the time of the accident, and were being delivered to Haywood Regional Medical Center in Clyde, NC. Although the delivery vehicle appeared to have rolled over several times, no cases were ejected. However, a hazmat team responded to the scene and closed the eastbound lanes of the interstate for several hours. Corporate Health Physicist Chris Walters made phone contact with Chief Lee Turner, who was on the scene of the accident, at approximately 11 :40 am to assess the situation. As a result of that conversation, he requested an on-site visit from the corporate Radiation Protection team. Chief Turner relayed that he had also alerted the TN Division of Radiological Health. At approximately 1:00 PM, Corporate Radiation Safety Officer Elizabeth Gillenwalters and Health Physicist Chris Hile arrived at the scene of the accident. Using a Ludlum 44-9 pancake probe with a Model 3 Meter and a Ludlum 26-1 Integrated Frisker, very careful surveys of the vehicle, one officer&amp;#x27;s clothing that had been reported as possibly contaminated, and the surrounding area were performed. No results greater than background were identified in any areas or materials surveyed. The officer&amp;#x27;s clothing items were left at the scene. All three delivery cases were still intact with the security zip tie still in place. Each case was thoroughly wiped on the outside, and the wipes surveyed with the Ludlum 26-1 Integrated Frisker. No results greater than background were identified, verifying no material had left containment. The cases were loaded into our vehicle and returned them to the PETNET UT Knoxville facility, located within the UT Medical Center. Additional photos of the packages and the scene are included in Attachments 2 and 3, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: Driver had been making propane deliveries during the remnants of Hurricane Helene.  Weather conditions were rainy with very high gusty winds.  Driver stated that heavy wind gust caught the truck and pushed the truck toward the shoulder of the roadway.  Right side tires dropped off the asphalt and when the driver corrected truck proceeded to overturn in the roadway and rolled coming to a stop on its side.  Impact from the rollover damage one of the vapor return valves on the back of the truck and it started leaking propane.  Area was secured when law enforcement arrived at the scene.  Roadway was closed due to leaking propane.  Fire Department and Greenville TN Hazmat team also responded to the site.   Response team connected a vapor hose to the truck and routed it away from the truck so that vapor could be flared off to reduce the vapor pressure in the tank.  Once the vapor pressure the was reduced the leak subsequently stopped so that the truck could be returned to its wheels and towed from the site.&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: At 23:00 ET, XPO notified ERTS of a cargo release at terminal NNA. It was reported that approximately 137.5 gallons of UN3266 Natural HDPE FCL13 released from a plastic tote due to a pole on another piece of freight puncturing the tote during the unloading process. The release impacted inside of trailer #3153521 and asphalt. ERTS reviewed the SDS with the caller and determined that terminal personnel are not capable of cleaning the release with PPE available on site.  Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 180-gallons of product released to a 300-yard x 400-yard are of the asphalt lot as well as the trailer floor. Absorbents were deployed and worked into the impacted areas. The remaining material in the tote was transferred into a new one. The damaged tote was then cut up and containerized. All impacted absorbents and the cut up poly tote were then containerized into (3) 55-gallon metal drums. The waste was staged onsite for terminal personnel to manage.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

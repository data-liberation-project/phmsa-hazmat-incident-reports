                &lt;li&gt;Description: On Monday February 5, 2024, at approximately 2:11 pm (CST), a flatbed semi-truck was transporting a mixed load of commercial waste when a fire was reported by the carriers driver. The driver immediately pulled over to the side of the interstate. The incident occurred on Interstate 40 west bound near mile marker 204, near White Bridge Rd in Nashville Tennessee. The Nashville Fire Department responded to the scene and extinguished the fire within minutes of notification. The fire involved a single package on a load of low-level and mixed low-level radioactive waste being shipped for disposal. The package that caught fire consisted of a soft-sided 90 cubic foot (3.5 yd3) multi-layered bag constructed of a 10 oz. geotextile non-woven polypropylene inner liner, with a double 20 mil high density polyethylene (HDPE) inner and outer liners with 4 mm rigid fiberboard in between the two 18 mil HOPE liners, meeting the General Design Criteria (49 CFR 173.410) and shipped in accordance with 49 CFR 173.427(b)(4) as an Exclusive Use Shipment.  The waste was being hauled on a flatbed semi-truck that had three separate containers placed on it. The fire was limited to the one soft-sided container towards the rear of the trailer. There was only minimal damage to the exterior of the other two containers (smoke) and no fire damage to the trailer. The items in the affected container consisted of both facility and customer waste with the majority being used personal protective equipment, facility trash, crushed drums, and other miscellaneous waste materials that were being transported to Texas for disposal. The transport vehicle was placarded with Class 7 Radioactive placards. The cause of the fire was not due to any defect or failure with the carriers truck or trailer, or any action of the carriers driver. Within hours, the shipper sent a response team to the incident site to secure the packaging for shipment back to its origin.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

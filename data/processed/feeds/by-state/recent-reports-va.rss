                &lt;li&gt;Description: SequenceEvent: Upon unloading a trailer the OPS Manager noticed the Hazmat package laying on it&amp;#x27;s side and discoloration on packaging due to it being wet. OPS Manager called for QA and QA placed the pkg in a hazmat container and into the hazmat cage. Upon inspection of the hazmat it was found that because of the package laying on it&amp;#x27;s side it caused pressure on one of the bottles causing it to leak slowly through the packaging. DescribePack: Closure of the bottle loosened a little due to pressure from being lain on it&amp;#x27;s side. DurationRel: 15 and MitigateEffect: QA Hazmat personnel placed the package into a hazmat container right side up to stop leaking.&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: SequenceEvent: When the contents were discovered being coded for a refusal at the station for being damaged, we discovered that the contents (Which were 2 2.5-gallon jugs of liquid machine detergent which was a hazmat under UN 1760 Corrosive liquids N.O.S. Technical name Sodium Hydroxide) have leaked a small amount of the contents out of the package. Some of the box is wet due on the exterior but that is rain that has soaked a portion of the packaging. Upon closure inspection the caps were loose, and the corrosive liquids were observed to originate at the affected area. None of the liquid contents from inside of the package has been released out of the box, but still leaked from the inner jugs. No inner packing was found inside of the package. DescribePack: The Jugs were observed to have no leaks upon discovery, but some of the liquid inside of the container was out of the container and was at the time of discovery staining the inner exterior box. The caps enclosing the jugs containing the corrosive solution were observed to be loose with the most recently escaped liquid appearing right below the cap. The caps on the containers were promptly tightened and no leaks were observed after test and observing for a leak. DurationRel: 3 and MitigateEffect: Upon awareness of the damaged hazmat, the caps were tightened prevent any further leaks.&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: On 2/6/2024 at approximately 1830, Dangerous Goods Administration received a call from Employee 4346935 is the station location in Hampton, reporting an undeclared dangerous goods shipment.  The package consisted of one fiberboard box, containing an inner fiberboard box with a glass bottle inside.  The attached paperwork identifies the commodity as &amp;quot;Hydrogen Sulfide&amp;quot;, prompting the opening of the shipment for verification.  The package was not prepared with the required DG markings, labeling, or paperwork, in accordance with IATA regulations and is being held, pending an FAA investigation.  UPDATE:  Further review revealed a misclassification of the commodity.  The commodity appears to be identified as &amp;quot;fuel oil&amp;quot; and as requesting that test be conducted using &amp;quot;hydrogen sulfide&amp;quot;.  The spill incident is being resubmitted with the updated classification.&lt;/li&gt;

The hose attached to the trailer UST became stuck under the pickup truck. The driver exited their truck and removed the hose from under his truck; and left the scene immediately. Police report was filed with VA State Police(Trooper J.B. Moore) for truck&amp;quot;leaving thâ‚¬ scene of the accident&amp;quot;. Fuel driver managed to capture a photo of the truck that ran over the fitting and hoses and reported the incident to Law Enforcement and the Safety Department immediately.

No fuel contaminated the ground nor entered into any water systems.&lt;/li&gt;

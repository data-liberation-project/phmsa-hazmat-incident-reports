The driver left Kinder Morgan headed towards Columbia on I-20 and got off the interstate on exit 22 which is HWY #1. The driver traveled down #1 Hwy until he got to Chinquapin Road in Monetta and turned right. Chinquapin Rd turned into Two Notch Road which is in Leesville SC. The driver made a right turn onto Pond Branch and proceeded towards exit 44. The driver came over the bridge slowing down so that he would be able to make the turn. The driver stated he didnâ€™t feel like he was speeding making the turn, but he never looked at the speedometer. The driver made his turn, and the truck proceeded to lay over on its side. The Lexington County Fire Service responded to the scene. The rollover resulted in approximately 1500 gallons of ULSD being released on to the ground. The spilt fuel was recovered/remediated by Republic Services. The remaining product was pumped from the rolled over trailer to a trailer brought on scene by Barnes Oil &amp;amp; Propane Representatives.&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: While loading an IBC into a trailer, forklift operator did not realize the forkblades from his forklift were protruding from it and as a result the forkblades hit and punctured another IBC already staged in the trailer consequently contributing to the unintentional release. Immediate containment procedures were put in place by Level III Hazwoper employees. Local authorities and a local third party spill response company were contacted. The VT State Hazmat Team responded as did our third party spill responder company. Spilled material was contained, neutralized, and cleaned up with various absorbents which were placed into various recovery containers. The remaining product that was still in IBC was neutralized and pumped out and placed into a recovery container. The punctured IBC was cut up and placed into recovery containers for proper disposal.&lt;/li&gt;

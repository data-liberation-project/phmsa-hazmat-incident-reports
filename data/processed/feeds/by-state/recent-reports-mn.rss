Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 1-cup of product released to a 2’ x 4’ area of the trailer floor due to leaking weld. The material was transferred from the damaged tote into a new one for shipment on. The impacted tote and trailer floor were cleaned with a purple power solution and wiped clean with absorbent pads. The impacted absorbents were then containerized into a 20-gallon metal drum. The waste was staged onsite for terminal personnel to manage.&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: Driver arrived at customer location to fill a Dimethylformamide(DMF) tank. He verified the tank, quantity, and connection prior to starting to pump. After several moments after beginning transfer, customer employee notified driver that nothing was transferring. Driver inspected the connections and proceeded to check on the internal valve, which he closed and opened again. After doing so a cap on the rear of the trailer popped off and product started coming out of the open pipe. Driver shutdown the pump and approximately 90 gallons of DMF spilled into the customer&amp;#x27;s containment. The cause of the release was the result of a faulty outlet cap. During the investigation it was determined that there was no isolation valve installed behind the cap.&lt;/li&gt;

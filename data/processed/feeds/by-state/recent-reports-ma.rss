                &lt;li&gt;Description: On October 16, 2024, at Eli Lilly&amp;#x27;s Boston facility, Veolia employees were in the process of loading drums onto a truck when they detected a solvent odor. Initially, they attributed the smell to recently filled drums. However, upon relocating the vehicle, they discovered a pinhole leak in the top of one drum, just below the upper chime.  The affected container was a 55-gallon plastic drum, and it is believed that the puncture occurred during its removal from the storage location. Upon discovering the leak, employees promptly reported the incident and transferred the leaking drum into an 851A2 salvage drum to ensure safe transportation to the final disposal facility.  Approximately one pint of halogenated solvent waste escaped from the drum. The spill was quickly contained using spill pads and absorbent materials. The leaking drum, along with the cleanup materials, was then placed into an appropriate salvage drum.  Given the small size of the hole and the rapid response of the team, the release is estimated to have lasted about 10 minutes. The drum was still largely full when the leak was detected, and the quantity released did not exceed the reportable quantity (RQ) threshold.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

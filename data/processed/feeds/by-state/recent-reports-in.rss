                &lt;li&gt;Description: On Tuesday, May 16, 2023 at 11:48am, I (Deputy Anthony Teal #5421} responded to a personal injury crash on Interstate 74, westbound at the 34 MM. At the time of the crash the weather was clear and the road surface was dry.  The driver (Michael Pender} of Vehicle #1 (white 2001 International 9100i, IN tag 3076627) advised he was traveling west on Interstate 74 pulling a tank trailer (IN tag SP698LBD} when he noticed vehicles slowing in front of him due to a traffic back up on the interstate offramp (roadWay construction on US Route 231 }. According to Michael, he felt like he had no where else to go but into the guardrail because another semi-trailer truck was blocking the left lane (passing lane). Michael&amp;#x27;s semi tractor and tank trailer struck the guardrail on the north side of the highway, overturned, and rolled down an embankment coming to rest on its passenger side. The tank trailer was carrying approximately 7,000-gallons of gasoline and 1,000-gallons of diesel fuel. The crash created a leak in the tanker that was carrying gasoline. Once the Crawfordsville Fire Department (CFO} arrived they were able stop the leak and contain the spill. Montgomery County Emergency Management (EMA} was contacted and arrived on scene to assist with the spill. Ultimately, a secondary tanker was brought to the scene by Bowman&amp;#x27;s (Brownsburg, IN} to offload the flammable liquids. The westbound lanes of Interstate 74 were closed for a period of time because of the accident. The wrecked semi tractor and tank trailer were recovered from the ditch by Wilson&amp;#x27;s Towing.  Driver Michael Pender appeared to be disoriented at the scene due to a head injury. He was able to self-extricate from his semi, but complained of pain to his head and was treated by Crawfordsville Fire Department Medics. Medics then transported him to Franciscan Hospital by ambulance (#4155 ).   Indiana State Police (ISP) Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Division arrived on scene and performed a vehicle inspection on Vehicle #1.  Witness Catherine Crosby stopped at the accident scene and provided a statement Catherine said she was driving west on Interstate 7 4 in the right lane (slow lane} when she observed two semi trucks in front of her occupying the left and right lanes. She stated that traffic in front of the semi trucks began to slow. She then saw the semi tractor with the tank trailer drive off the roadway, strike the guardrail, overturn three times, and end up at the bottom of an embankment. I inquired if she noticed anything about the driver of the semi. Catherine said nothing other than he appeared to have a head injury.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

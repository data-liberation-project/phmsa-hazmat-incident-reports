                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: On June 15th 2025, Ingenium experienced a trailer fire while transporting hazardous waste eastbound on Interstate 90. The incident occurred on the off-ramp at mile marker 191, temporarily blocking access. The fire originated in the rear section of the trailer.  According to the driver’s report, the incident began with a tire blowout, followed by a second blowout on the rear axle. The Automatic Valve System (AVS) failed to engage; likely due to damage from debris or the tire failure, causing the brakes to lock and overheat. This overheating generated sparks that are believed to have ignited the underside of the trailer.  Ingenium contacted and reported the incident to NRC (NRC# 1434197) when immediately available to do so.  The fire resulted in the partial destruction of manifested hazardous waste. Emergency responders, including the Murdo Volunteer Fire Department and Murdo Police Department, were immediately dispatched. Ingenium coordinated with its emergency response contractor, Ambipar (North Dakota), and worked alongside local and state authorities to secure the scene and begin cleanup operations.  Initial field assessments indicate that the majority of the damage occurred in the rear section of the trailer, which contained waste associated with Systech manifests. While many containers remained intact, all materials were transferred to new containers or salvage drums as a precaution.  Due to the extent of the incident, the waste shipments could not be delivered to the originally designated facilities (TSDFs) as planned. A portion of the waste was destroyed in the fire. The remaining materials were recovered, secured, and segregated for proper management. These recovered materials were subsequently shipped to an alternate permitted facility for identification, profiling, and compliant handling.  All recovered waste is being managed under EPA ID SDR000222927 (Ingenium Group, LLC) in accordance with Episodic Event reporting protocols, as the materials are now considered commingled with other manifested waste from the same trailer.  Regulatory notifications were submitted to: Oregon DEQ Hazardous Waste Program Washington State Department of Ecology  Impacted manifest numbers include: 000554545DAT, 000554550DAT, 000554552DAT, 000554555DAT, 000556777DAT, 000554526DAT, 000554528DAT, 000554537DAT, 000554540DAT, 000554544DAT, 000554548DAT, 000554551DAT, 000554553DAT, 000554556DAT, 000554573DAT, 000554583DAT, 000556767DAT, 000556769DAT, 000556775DAT, and 000556782DAT.  EPA Waste Codes Involved: D001, D002, D004–D008, D010, D011, D035, F003, F005.  Ingenium assumed full ownership of all hazardous materials on the trailer and subsequently obtained a temporary EPA Site ID for the fire location to facilitate proper management and reporting.  Per the South Dakota Department of Agriculture, Ingenium conducted excavation of areas potentially impacted by runoff from firefighting activities. These areas will be backfilled with clean fill and reseeded. Analytica&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: After the meal service I heard yelling and screaming and upon standing I saw sparks and flames shooting into the air over seat 1 F in all directions. The pax in 1 F was charging her iPhone with her own Anker power bank which apparently exploded into flames and sparks in her lap. She stood up and the power bank was on the carpet in front of the seat in flames and shooting sparks. I immediately notified the cockpit and crew and donned the PBE and used the halon in F class to extinguish the flames. The battery continued to smolder and hiss. The#2 brought up the containment bag and other halons and eq and I placed the smoldering device in the bag following the procedures on the bag. 8L of water were used. The cord was burned as well as the pax blouse and napkin. The passenger&amp;#x27;s left hand was burned as well her wrist. The#2 applied the burn gel and I bandaged her hand and wrist. Blistering was appearing on her wrist and pax requested and was given a small bag of ice as well. Pax denied medical assistance on the ground but plane was met by medics staff and Pax went with them. Bag was contained in an empty cart in F class and monitored for the flight. No further incidence was noted. Pax took her own anti inflammatory medicine and stated she was staying in SJO with 2 doctors. Battery was an Anker power bank 10,000. It was not plugged into the seat but was plugged into and changing her phone inflight. Pax thanked the crew profusely for our quick handling of the situation. Smoke filled the cabin but dissipated within about 30 minutes. The smell in F class remained however. Several passengers were coughing and had burning eyes as a result. Crew seems ok. I sustained slight bums on right and left hand from the sparks and have a sore throat and burning eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

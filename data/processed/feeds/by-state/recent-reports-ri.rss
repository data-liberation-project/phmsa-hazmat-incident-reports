                &lt;li&gt;Description: Captain notified to SOC in NRT at 11:42L by ACARS. Thermal containment bag was used for 8A customer&amp;#x27;s IPAD, which was stuck on rail of her seat and broken. Upon arrival at NRT, CS SPVR retrieved the bag and IPAD was crushed. The customer agreed for us to confiscate at NRT due to no way to repair. We learned that she was not aware of dropping her IPAD at her seat rail, when she was reclining her seat, then she heard the sound of a crack which caused by breaking IPAD. No fire, no smoke and no heat were produced, but for safety, FA used the thermal containment bag and placed at designated location during flight. Passenger Information:, Name: Carol Pulliam Address: 167 N. Cleveland Ave#400 Oceanside, CA 92054 Phone: 951-543-8608 Email: myrtle007@sbcglobal.net&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: No&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: From employee witness: During a cabin walk-through, I noticed a strong chemical smell. I could see a flight attendant speaking with a passenger in the aisle of the B zone cabin. They were standing next to a Polaris seat with a flashlight. I immediately asked the flight attendant what was happening, and where the smell was coming from. He showed me a broken cell phone belonging to 12A Norris Dodson. From what I was told, Mr. Dodson woke sometime prior and realized his phone was no longer on his person. He notified flight attendant and asked for help in retrieving it. In the process of searching for the phone, flight attendant activated the electronic seat controls. The phone was crushed by the mechanism and the lithium battery was punctured. When I arrived at the seat, the phone was hot to the touch. There was no smoke, or any other indicator of fire. But to be safe, between the chemical smell and the heat of the phone, I decided to place the phone in the thermal containment bag. The pilots were notified, and the information was sent to Ground staff.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: The material was picked up at the shipper&amp;#x27;s location in the morning. There was no evidence of a leak at that time. At the 2nd stop of the day, there was an odor in the back of the truck but no observable liquid. The truck returned to the transporter facility and at that point, there was some visible liquid on the container, but no liquid on the floor of the truck. Leaked amount was less than 1 liter.  A new gasket was procured, and when the lid was removed to replace the gasket, it was observed that the original gasket had a small section that was not fully seated around the edge. The used gasket was removed and a new one was correctly installed. The shipment continued without further issue.&lt;/li&gt;

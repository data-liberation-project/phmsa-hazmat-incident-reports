EWI indicated that there was 60&amp;#x27; x 60&amp;#x27; area of soil impacted by the cargo and a 60&amp;#x27; x 150&amp;#x27; area of the roadway impacted. EWI personnel applied absorbent materials to the roadway and will have to return to excavate the site. EWI personnel excavated the area and stockpiled it off the side of the roadway.

                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: No&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: Material was picked up at shipper&amp;#x27;s location in morning, no evidence of any leak at that time. At 2nd stop of the day driver conducted regular inspection of lading and noticed small amount of liquid atop IBC, not leaking to floor of truck. Driver took precaution of tightening ring bolt further. At 3rd and final stop of this day no evidence of further leaking. Immediately after this incident we reached out to IBC manufacturer to inquire about different gaskets that may be better suited for package/lading. They sent a representative to our facility on 6/20/24 and it was determined the gaskets were appropriate for shipment. What was discovered was that manufacturer&amp;#x27;s original closure instructions has been changed since purchase of this container. Original instructions were 30 ft/lbs torque on closures. This was updated after the fact to 40 ft/lbs. We had a subsequent and very similar leak on 6/4/24 (before manufacturer rep arrived and updated instructions), see previous report on this event.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

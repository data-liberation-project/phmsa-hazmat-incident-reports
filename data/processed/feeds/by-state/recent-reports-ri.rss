                &lt;li&gt;Description: Material part of consolidated shipment.  Upon loading truck, driver confirmed closure and all appeared in compliance and well.  Upon delivery of material to 3-day terminal, driver inspected load and discovered small discharge of HW that appeared to emanate from manway closure.  We have seen failure with closures in past and will conduct investigation with package manufacturer.  Small release of less than 3 fluid oz. of material were cleaned up by our staff and properly disposed of.&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: No&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: Railcar CTCX 135391 was hooked up and offloading, it was coupled to 1 of 4 residue last contained rail cars which were scheduled to be switched out. In between the residue last contained and the full cars that were coupled together, there was a derail and blue flag applied to the rail track. Railroad personnel (on site conductor from Seaview) didn’t check to see if residue last contained cars were uncoupled from the full car (railroad procedure is for onsite conductor to verify that cars are uncoupled) and as such Seaview pulled the full car along with the residue last contained car. The full rail car also had a wheel chock on it. When the offloading (full) railcar was pulled, the bridge bent on rail tower and one liquid hose snapped off the pipe nipple. The railcar wheel went over top of derail and went over the wheel chock.  The derail is designed to stop cars incoming but designed to stop from opposite direction (outgoing). One liquid hose snapped at fitting and propane released into air from the railcar and hose. This triggered the LEL detectors which initiated a shutdown, and all valves were closed. The hose released until nothing was left from end of valve to tip of hose. While the rail car was still releasing an operator climbed car and turned a valve on top of rail car at 3:30 pm.      • 3: 25 pm-start of incident. • 3:30 pm-Site operator turned valve on top of railcar to stop release.  • 3:45 pm-- fire dept on site. No vapor cloud observed but did smell residual odor.  • 4:00 pm--Alex on site.  • Shortly after 4:00 pm RI Dept of Env Mgt arrived.  DEM requested report to be filed with NRC. NRC report           number 1418172. DEM contact was Jason Kasawa, 401-255-2910.  • 5:00 pm- The facility was cleared by fire dept to unhook railcar.  Site personnel unhooked rail car and                         derailed it and closed it so Seaview could move it back on track. Fire dept requested the facility                          to lock process on damaged arm.  • 5:15 pm-Fire Dept returned control to facility.   Estimated quantity: Less than 50 gallons. Estimate based on end of valve tip of hose (approx. 20 ft) 2 mins of release before valve was closed to railcar.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

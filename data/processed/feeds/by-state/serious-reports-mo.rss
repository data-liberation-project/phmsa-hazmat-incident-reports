                &lt;li&gt;Description: On February 12, 2025, at 0846 ET, Emergency Response and Training Solutions (ERTS) was contacted by Landstar Ranger personnel in Troy, MO regarding a vehicle accident that impacted several cargo products.  Contractors were dispatched to the site to perform all onsite clean-up activities. Upon arrival, contractors found (1) 330-gallon tote of Chlorite solution (UN1908, 8, III), (47) 15-gallon drums of Sodium bisulfate (UN2837, 8, III), and 456 gallons of Citric acid and Copper sulfate pentahydrate (UN1760, 8, III) to be damaged but not leaking. The release was reportedly due to a trailer fire, impacting asphalt and soil. No drains or waterways were impacted by the release. The release was cleaned up with absorbents and the proper PPE. All impacted soil was excavated and backfilled. All waste generated from addressing this release was containerized in (19) roll-offs, (1) 330-gallon tote, and (1) 55-gallon DM which were taken offsite by the contractor for proper disposal. On April 23, 2025, approximately 430 gallons of recovered Sodium bisulfate was transferred into 2 totes. There was 705 gallons of Sodium bisulfate on the BOL - so up to 275 gallons of pH Safe was released or solidified and that is what is included on this report. Again, the confirmed spilled amount of this material was not discovered until April 23, 2025, which is why it is now be reported.&lt;/li&gt;

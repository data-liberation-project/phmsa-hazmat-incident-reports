                &lt;li&gt;Description: On May 15, 2025, at 1215 ET, Emergency Response and Training Solutions (ERTS) was contacted by Landstar Ranger personnel in Washington, MO regarding the release of Ethanol. Contractors were dispatched to the site to perform all onsite clean-up activities. Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of 275.0 gallons of Ethanol (UN1170, 3, II) from (1) 270-gal poy tote and (1) 5-gal plastic pail onto asphalt and the trailer floor. The release was reportedly due to a load shift as the tote slid into a pallet, impacting the trailer floor and a 1’ x 2’ area of asphalt. No drains or waterways were impacted by the release. The release was cleaned up with absorbents and the proper PPE. Damaged pails of product were overpacked in a flex bin by the contractors to leave with the consignee and send back to the shipper. All waste generated from addressing this release was containerized in (2) 55-gallon DGs which were taken off-site by the contractor pending proper disposal.&lt;/li&gt;

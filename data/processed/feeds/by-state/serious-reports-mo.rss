                &lt;li&gt;Description: On 12-30-2024 at 1420 hours central time I was notified by our driver that he had overturned his truck while pulling a load of Creosote. He was traveling south on Missouri Hwy 21, near Arcadia, MO, and when negotiating a left curve traveled partially off the west edge of roadway, onto a soft shoulder. In an attempt to regain control, he overcorrected, lost control and overturned onto the passenger side. The rear head fastened to the side wall of tanker (231) wall ruptured, causing more than 30,000 lbs. of material to leak onto the ground, and continued to leak for approximately five hours.   The commodity being transported was Creosote, UN 3082 a Class 9 hazard. Emergency services, Pilot Knob Fire Protection District, Missouri Hwy Patrol, and Missouri DOT Hazmat Team (MDOTHT) arrived on scene. The Missouri state EPA was contacted, and I spoke with Sharon Kennedy and Greg Dillon informing them of all updates. I contacted the National Response Center (NRC) to report on the chemical spill and was provided an incident number (1420166). In addition, I was contacted by Liam Hazen, who is the disaster coordinator for the MODNR Environmental Emergency Response Section. He provided a list of hazardous material contractor cleanup teams.   At approximately 1720 hours central I contacted Environmental Restoration LLC; an environmental clean-up team located near St Louis and spoke with their representative, William Lieneke, and he accepted the agreement to conduct the cleanup. Upon arriving on scene, William Lieneke made an evaluation and operated an excavator to build a berm to block the creosote from draining into a nearby stream. Lieneke has filed with the state to obtain the required permits to initiate the removal and disposal of the Creosote.  At approximately 0149 hours Mr. Lieneke informed me he received authority from the state DNR representative to turn the truck and trailer from the side to the upright position. Trailer (231) was no longer leaking material due to hardening.  At approximately 0410 hours the remaining Creosote was pumped off the damaged tanker (231) and onto a replacement tanker and truck.  The remaining material was then transported back to the facility of origin, Omaha Track located in Granite City, Illinois.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

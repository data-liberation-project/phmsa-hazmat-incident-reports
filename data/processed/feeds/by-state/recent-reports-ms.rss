                &lt;li&gt;Description: On November 16, 2023, at 0830 ET, XPO Logistics Terminal LJS experienced an over the road diesel fuel and hazardous cargo release due to a single vehicle rollover accident. The unit left the roadway resulting in a release to the shoulder soil. On November 16, 2023, at 0935 ET, XPO Logistics retained ERTS to manage and oversee the incident. ERTS dispatched ES&amp;amp;H to the site to perform all cleanup and remediation activities. On November 16, 2023, at 1230 ET, ES&amp;amp;H personnel arrived on site and began assisting the onsite wrecker company, Lewis Wrecker Service, with clearing the wreckage debris. The wrecker company hauled the two damaged trailers offsite after conducting a soil/debris scrape to remove as much material and debris from the ground. ES&amp;amp;H personnel were able to confirm approximately 25-gallon of diesel released from a damaged saddle tank along with approximately 100-gallons of UN1210 STR Steam Mat from (2) 55-gallon metal drums, and approximately 1- quart of UN3077 Cyasorb THT 7001 EF Light Stabilizer (PGIII) from a single 50-pound poly bag. The impacted soil area was confirmed to measure approximately 20’ x 30’. The contractors confirmed the majority of the cargo released to the inner trailer and freight. A roll off was utilized to containerize (20) 55-gallon metal drums of STR Steam Mat that were not releasing, along with two empty drums of this product. A total of (60) 50-pound bags of Cyasorb were individually poly wrapped and placed in the roll off. A total of (6) 5-gallon poly jugs of non-regulated PureOil Formulation K were placed into the roll off. One 55-gallon poly drum of debris, impacted grass, and soil was also generated and staged in the roll off. The roll off was then hauled to the wrecker yard. On November 17, 2023, ES&amp;amp;H personnel returned to the site to assess the area and complete final cleanup. ES&amp;amp;H located a small indent in the ground measuring 4&amp;#x27; x 18&amp;quot; that was still impacted by some free-standing liquid of UN1210 STR Steam Mat. ES&amp;amp;H solidified the material with acid gator and collected it into their poly waste bags. Acid gator was deployed near the tree as well. An additional 17 bags of impacted mud, dirt, leaves, and acid gator were generated and removed from site. The bags were hauled to the roll off and placed inside pending overpacking. On November 20, 2023, ES&amp;amp;H personnel returned to the wrecker yard for waste containerizing. The (20) 55-gallon drums of UN1210 STR Steam Mat were wiped down and shrink wrapped 4 to a pallet for salvage. The two empty drums of STR Steam Mat were crushed and containerized into a 55-gallon poly drum along with poly sheeting for disposal. All (60) 50-pound bags of UN3077 Cyasorb THT 7001 EF Light Stabilizer (PGIII) were containerized into 3 supersacks for disposal. The (6) 5-gallon poly jugs of PureOil Formulation K were poly wrapped to a pallet for disposal. All poly bags containing wreckage debris, mud, grass, soil, leaves, sticks, acid gator impacted with diesel &amp;amp; UN1210 were contain&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: XPO Logistics terminal LJS experienced a UN3286 EC1417A release from a 350-gallon metal tote. ERTS dispatched contractors to conduct cleanup operations. Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 0.5-gallons of product released to a 1’ x 1’ area of the trailer floor as well as the tote body. The lid to the tote was not secure causing a release. The tote and impacted trailer floor were wiped down and cleaned with simple green. All impacted pads and PPE were then placed into a 55-gallon poly drum. The crew removed and cleaned the gasket which was then reseated, they then tightened the bolts and conducted a slosh test to ensure there would be no further release. The waste was staged onsite for terminal personnel to manage.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

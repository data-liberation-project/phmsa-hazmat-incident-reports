                &lt;li&gt;Description: X-2025021177-On 01/30/2025 a CN transportation employee observed liquid coming from the top and running down the side of tank car # TILX 198075 (Loaded / Alcohols N.O.S. / UN 1987 / Class 3) at the CN Hattiesburg Yard located in Hattiesburg, MS. The employee notified the on-duty transportation manager who in turn notified the CN Dangerous Goods Team that responded to the incident. The responding DG Officer noted dried spillage on the sides of all 4 of the tank car upon arrival. Further assessment the manway cover swing bolts were less than tool-tight and could easily be turned by hand allowing the contents to leak during transportation due to an improper seal of the manway covers. Shipper-applied security seals were found to be intact at the time of assessment. The manway cover was opened for the purpose of inspecting the gasket followed by the tightening of the swing bolts in a star pattern with a 24# pipe wrench. The tank car was released for continued transportation to destination. There was no ground contamination, exposures or injuries as a result of the leak.

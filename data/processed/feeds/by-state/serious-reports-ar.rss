                &lt;li&gt;Description: Car was found releasing vapor as it went through Beebe, AR and was stopped by the local FD outside McRae, AR.  The FD conducted a 1/2-mile evacuation and isolated the area.  Upon HMM arrival, we met with the FD and was granted approval to access the car.  Upon inspection of the car, liquid was observed releasing from under the valve at the connection of the 4-bolt valve flange to the flanged riser due to all four nuts that secure the valve to the flange not secured.  The four nuts were found inside the protective housing.  The pressure was removed from the car, the leak stopped, and the four bolts properly secured.  The car was neutralized and set out.  An OTMA-1 was granted for movement back to the shipper.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

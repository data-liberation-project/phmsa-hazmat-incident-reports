                &lt;li&gt;Description: Jesse Marquez-Zamora was traveling northbound on freeway 101 at 50 mph on 10-3-2024 at approximately 820am. The vehicle traveling in front of Jesse proceeded to heavy brake. Jesse then proceeded to apply his brakes, but it was not enough to stop his propane bobtail. Jesse then attempted to maneuver around the vehicle in front of him to the left, this was when Jesse lost control of the truck. Jesse&amp;#x27;s truck then proceeded to hit the vehicle in front of him and rolled 2 times, there were a total of 4 vehicles involved. During the rollover a piped valve was knocked off causing the release of approximately 2240 gallons of propane. Jesse and another individual were taken to the ER for evaluation then released&lt;/li&gt;

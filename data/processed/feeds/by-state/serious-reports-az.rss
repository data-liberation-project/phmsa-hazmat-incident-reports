                &lt;li&gt;Description: On February 5, 2025, at 7:17 PM MST Facility operations personnel began discharging rail cars of denatured ethanol into a header which was believed to deliver product to the Facility tank farm for product storage. A total of six (6) railcars were connected to an approximately 1900 foot incomplete, under construction product header which contained an open 12&amp;quot; flange with dust cap, and thirteen (13) open piping elbows.  At 8:49 PM MST Facility operators discovered the release along the incomplete product header and shutdown unloading pumps and closed valves on product railcars by 9:01 PM MST. Over the 1.5-hour period, a total of 82,431 gallons of denatured was released across an approximately 730&amp;#x27; section of the product header from the six (6) railcars that were connected. The denatured ethanol impacted the underlying ballast and migrated to the West and South of the direct spill area to low-lying areas on the leased property and the Burlington Northern &amp;amp; Santa Fe (BNSF) Railroad property.&lt;/li&gt;

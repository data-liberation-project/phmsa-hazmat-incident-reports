                &lt;li&gt;Description: XPO Logistics terminal BCH experienced a UN3082 Rhonox Herbicide release from a 275-gallon poly tote. ERTS dispatched contractors to conduct cleanup operations. Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 165-gallons of product released due to a forklift puncture. The entire trailer floor, a 150’ x 30’ area of the concrete lot below, and 4 drains and 1 catch basin were impacted. All drains lead to the catch basin where the material was contained. The crew utilized a vac truck to remove the product from the catch basin and drains leading to it. Absorbents were deployed to the trailer and concrete lot and worked in. Once the drains were done, absorbent boom was placed in them to collect any residual material. The product remaining the damaged tote was pumped out and the damaged tote was cut up and containerized. Crew returned to site and inspected the drains and flushed and vacuumed them out again. Additional wastewater was generated to be offloaded into totes. Samples were collected to confirm that no residual material remains in the catch basin and samples were collected from the nearby retention pond as well as a precaution. All wastewater was offloaded into totes and all solid cleanup debris was containerized into 55-gallon poly drums. The waste was staged onsite for terminal personnel to manage&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: Our vehicle was approaching a controlled intersection at 10 MPH. To our left, a vehicle (Class 5 or 6 pickup towing equipment) was turning onto the roadway. Conditions were wet and snowy, the other vehicle lost control. The other unit spun out and his trailer came around and hit our truck and tank. The other driver&amp;#x27;s trailer broke away from the pickup and lodged into the side of our tanker, thus resulting in a puncture to the middle compartment. The puncture is located about two thirds of the way down, in the middle compartment. Our driver maintained full control of his vehicle, stopped immediately, and initiated spill protocol. The road closure was to secure the accident scene and reopened upon vehicle removal. Pictures and reports are attached.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

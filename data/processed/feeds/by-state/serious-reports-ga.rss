                &lt;li&gt;Description: While driving eastbound(speed unknown) on Highway 74 at approximately 6:00 AM on 12/16/2024, the vehicle hit a cow that was in the middle of the road. The driver reported heavy fog at the time of the collision. As a result of the collision, the vehicle left the roadway onto the eastbound shoulder of the road and burst into flames. The driver escaped the vehicle and called emergency medical services. h Upon theif arrival on the scene shortly after the accident, law enforcement closed the eastbound lane of the road. This lane of the road remained closed for several hours until being reopened following decontamination of the area in the evening on December 16. After the vehicle caught fire, the flames consumed the vehicle, 6reaching the shipping container and several of the unit dose shields and spreading some radioactive contamination in the general vicinity of the vehicle. EMS worked to extinguish the fire and in doing so, spread some contamination further around the area, reaching approximately 15-20 feet away from the vehicle. Two of the unit dose pigs were later identified in the debris, while another two items that may have been unit dose pigs were also identified. The other pigs appear to have fully melted in the fire and their materials released. It was not possible to identify which specific doses&amp;#x27; pigs were intact. Cleanup was conducted by a contractor, Alpha-Omega Training&amp;amp; Compliance, Inc., with direction by Cardinal Health and a representative from the Georgia DNR Radioactive Materials Program. The area was found to be at background levels after cleanup concluded on the evening of 12/16.&lt;/li&gt;

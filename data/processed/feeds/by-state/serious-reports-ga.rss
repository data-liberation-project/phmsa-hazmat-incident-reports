                &lt;li&gt;Description: On September 17, 2024, at 1141 ET, Emergency Response and Training Solutions (ERTS) was contacted by Landstar personnel in Lithonia, Georgia regarding the release of NALCOÂ® BT-3011 BOILER WATER TREATMENT.  Contractors were dispatched to the site to perform all onsite clean-up activities. Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of 260 gallons of Nalco BT-3011 Boiler Water Treatment (Sodium Hydroxide Solution, UN1824, 8, III) from (1) IBC plastic tote. The release was caused by a puncture and impacted the trailer floor, and multiple small areas of concrete as the trailer was in motion, that were unrecoverable. The residual material in the damaged tote was neutralized and solidified with absorbents, the damaged tote was cut up, then the trailer was neutralized and cleaned. Contractors also confirmed a 1ft x 6inch area of soil was impacted. Contractors were able to collect the impacted soil without complication. All waste was containerized in (4) 55-gallon DFs and taken offsite by contractors for proper disposal.&lt;/li&gt;

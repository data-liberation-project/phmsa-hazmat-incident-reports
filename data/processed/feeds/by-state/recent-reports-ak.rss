                &lt;li&gt;Description: Tank truck and pup trailer were involved in a rollover incident while trying to enter the customer&amp;#x27;s site- Costco Wholesale, 300 W. Dimond Blvd, Anchorage, AK. The tank shell failed when it experienced an abrasion during the rollover. The driver was removed from the vehicle and the fire dept placed putty on the tank shell to stop the release of additional hazardous material. Once the scene was rendered safe by the fire department, cleanup operations commenced with the placement of absorbent boom and absorbent materials. Storm drains and manways were blocked. Released matter was contained to less than a 200 square foot area. Product was transferred out of the containers and delivered to the intended destination. Variance of what was lifted versus metered into the customer tank was approximately 20USWG.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

The shipment consisted of one fiberboard box, containing 10 inner boxes, and each of those contained 10 plastic bags containing safety matches.  The shipment was flagged and opened by the Customs division.  The Commercial Invoice identified the inner contents as &amp;quot;arithmetical bar&amp;quot;; however, Customs discovered a contradicting image in X-ray screening.  Upon making the discovery, Customs submitted the package to FedEx Dangerous Goods department for proper reporting.  The shipment was not prepared in accordance with IATA Regulations missing the required markings, labeling, packaging and paperwork.  The shipment is being held, pending an FAA investigation.&lt;/li&gt;

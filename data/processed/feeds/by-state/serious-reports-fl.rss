            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a link="None"&gt;Report E-2025030431&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Identified by scraper @ 2025-04-15T00:53:32+00:00&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Incident Date: 2025-02-22&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;City: Lakeland&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;State: FL&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Report Type: A hazardous material incident&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Mode Of Transportation: Highway&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Carrier/Reporter: AQUA CLEAN ENVIRONMENTAL CO INC&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Hazmat Fatalities: 0&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Hazmat Injuries: 0&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Non-Hazmat Fatalities: 0&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Total Amount Of Damages: 71000&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: The undeclared hazardous materials were tendered by a third party and picked up by carrier and delivered to destination facility (wastewater treatment facility were described as non-regulated wastewater) and as such the incident constituted an undeclared material that was non-conforming to the approval issued by consignee. On inquiry with the shipper/wastewater generator, it was discovered that an unknown quantity of sodium hydroxide had been combined with the wastewater. The wastewater was placed into a tanker of aluminum construction, so the mechanism of failure appears straightforward. The release occurred on consignee property before being assessed for formal receipt and treatment. The release was controlled and the affected area is being remediated.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

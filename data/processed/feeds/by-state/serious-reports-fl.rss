                &lt;li&gt;Description: It was reported that approximately 500-gallons of gasoline released from one (1) tanker truck due to the driver attempting to switch trailers, but the weight was too heavy, causing the landing gear to go through the bottom of the trailer and the tank fell on the ground. The release impacted the asphalt parking lot and ditch that is in the center of the parking lot. Emergency response contractor HEPACO arrived on site and performed an initial clean up and collected an estimated 11,000 gallons of Liquid waste from the ditch and placed it into a frac-tank. The soil ditch area is pending remediation. No storm drains were reported impacted by the release.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: The drivers left the shippers facility enroute to the final destination. Upon entering highway traffic, the driver encountered vehicles that were not merging correctly and driving aggressively. They brake checked each other and the truck driver had to do emergency braking maneuver to avoid collision with the 2 other vehicles. The load shifted forward, and 2 IBCs shifted and pushed barrels together after the load securement failed. The drum of ferric chloride was crushed by one of the other barrels, causing a crack at the bottom corner of the barrel. The duration of the release was approximately 1.5 hours. The local fire department was called and was on scene along with WY DOT personnel as it happened at the Wyoming Port of Entry. The Laramie County fire department had sand delivered and built a berm and used absorbent to stop the spread of the spill.  Clean Harbors was contacted by the company to handle the remediation.  The fire department left the scene once the leak stopped and Clean Harbors was enroute from Denver, CO.  Clean Harbors unloaded the trailer in order to find the compromised drum, which was put into a 95-gallon overpack to contain and neutralize it with soda ash.  The crew then decontaminated the trailer using a mix of water and speedy dry.  All waste associated with the decontamination was then shoveled and wiped into a 55-gallon poly drum which was picked up the following day.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

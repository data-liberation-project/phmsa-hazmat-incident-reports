                &lt;li&gt;Description: AmeriGas cargo tank vehicle (bobtail) was traveling west on Roosevelt Highway in Kendell, NY.  A 3rd party motorcycle entered the roadway at an intersection directly in front the AmeriGas vehicle.  The AmeriGas vehicle did not have a stop sign and had the right of way.  The motorcycle entering the intersection had a stop sign from the side road.  The AmeriGas vehicle swerved left into the east bound lane to avoid impact with the motorcycle.  As the AmeriGas vehicle swerved to the left, the left side wheel left the roadway which led the vehicle into an oncoming tree.  The AmeriGas vehicle impacted the tree head-on with the left front corner of the vehicle.  Subsequently, the vehicle spun around and rolled over 360 degrees across the roadway, coming to rest back on the wheels.  The rollover damaged the rear deck of the vehicle which resulted in breaking a vapor return pipe off at the cargo tank.  Propane vapor was released from the cargo tank through the vapor piping connection port.  The port had a back check valve installed but it did not set due to damage from the impact.  Emergency responders (fire company personnel) ultimately were able to stop the leakage by tapping and manipulating the back check valve to make it set.   The driver of the AmeriGas vehicle suffered injuries in the cab of the truck during the rollover and was hospitalized.   The 3rd party motorcyclist fled the scene.&lt;/li&gt;

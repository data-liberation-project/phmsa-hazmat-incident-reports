                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: No&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: Following the aircraft’s departure from OMA to VPS, a service-provider agent notified their leadership that a personal e-cigarette (UN3481) could not be located and was believed to have been left in the cargo compartment where they were working. Leadership immediately informed the Operations Control Center, which relayed the information to the Pilot-in-Command. Existing guidance in the General Operations Manual addresses only hazardous materials found “within the cabin,” leaving the PIC initially uncertain about the appropriate action that should be taken. As a precautionary measure, the PIC elected to divert the aircraft to XNA. Once the aircraft was grounded, a service agent was able to locate the device (UN3481) within the cargo space and remove it. There was no indication of damage to the AC. There was no photo taken at the time of identification. This was not intended to be a shipment of hazardous materials, and no shipper declaration was created.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: At 14:02 PM ET, XDM contacted the call center to report a spill that occurred at a Fat Dog&amp;#x27;s truck stop, located at 1730 Highway 10 in Gibbon, NE. The spill consists of approximately 3 gallons or more of a UN2809 mercury, which released from a metallic cylinder contained inside of a wooden crate. The driver stated he cannot get close enough to inspect the cylinder and provide a trade name as the substance is too dangerous, and they are not in possession of a BOL either. The spill is inside the trailer and has leaked out onto the asphalt beneath the trailer. ERTS will dispatch a contractor to assist.   Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 1 teaspoon of Mercury product and .5-gallon motor oil was released to trailer and asphalt due to load shift. The waste, PPE and impacted absorbents were containerized into (2) 55-gallon poly drums and Mercury waste was placed in a 5-gallon poly before it was placed in a (1) 35-gallon poly drum. The waste is staged for TSDF to pick up.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

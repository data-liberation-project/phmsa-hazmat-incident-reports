                &lt;li&gt;Description: XPO Logistics terminal XCF experienced a customer location release of UN2693 Sodium Bisulfite Solution 40% from (3) 275-gallon poly totes. ERTS dispatched contractors to conduct cleanup operations. Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 5-gallons of product released to a 10’ x 30’ area of the trailer and concrete lot below. The release occurred due to high temps expanding the totes/loose caps as well as small puncture holes in the tote bodies. The material in the three totes were transferred into new totes. Soda ash was utilized to neutralize the release &amp;amp; absorbents were then deployed to clean all released product. All impacted absorbents were containerized into a 55-gallon poly drum. The damaged totes were then cut up and containerized into (4) 55-gallon poly drums. The waste was removed from site pending disposal.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

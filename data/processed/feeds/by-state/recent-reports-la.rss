                &lt;li&gt;Description: XPO Logistics contacted ERTS regarding a roadside release of Kurifloc 7115 from a 275-gallon tote as a result of  improper loading / inadequate preparation for transportation. The tote became crushed under falling freight  breaking the cap and causing the release during transit. Approximately 10-gallons of product released onto the  trailer floor, the asphalt beneath the trailer, and the concrete parking lot. The impact areas include the trailer  floor: 4&amp;#x27;x4&amp;#x27;, asphalt beneath the trailer: 2&amp;#x27;x8&amp;#x27;, and concrete parking lot: 3&amp;#x27;x20&amp;#x27;. A Contractor secured the freight for the trailer to pull into a parking lot where a tote transfer was performed and the trailer floor was neutralized  with white vinegar. The transferred tote was loaded onto trailer while the damaged tote was taken by the  Contractor to XPO’s Shreveport, LA terminal to be cut-up and containerized for waste disposal. Additionally,  one drum containing PPE, impacted oil dry, and impacted absorbent rags was generated for waste disposal. No  storm-drains, soil, or waterways were impacted by this incident.&lt;/li&gt;

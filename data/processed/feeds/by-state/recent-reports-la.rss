                &lt;li&gt;Description: On Friday, May 17, 2024, a Occidental Chemical driver made a delivery of Hydrochloric acid to the Occidental Chemical plant located in Hahnville, LA. The Occidental Chemical driver was loaded at an IMTT facility located in Geismar, LA. While the unloading process was underway, it was discovered that the bleeder valve on the product transfer line that goes to the product storage tank was left open. This resulted in approximately 2600 gallons of Hydrochloric acid being released from the product line into the containment area. No injuries or exposure to chemical occurred as a result of this event, as well as no off-site impact or environmental impact. The offloading process was halted, bleeder valve closed, containment area drained to sump for processing, and remainder of offload was completed.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: No&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: On 05-12-2024 a CN transportation employee observed liquid dripping from the bottom outlet valve cap during routine work operations at the CN Geismar Yard in Geismar, LA. The employee notified the on-duty transportation manager who then initiated an emergency response from the CN Dangerous Goods Team.  The responding CN DGO observed liquid dripping from the Bottom Outlet Valve cap (attached) with a strong vinegar type odor in the area. It was also noted that the valve handle was found to be in the fully closed position with a shipper supplied security seal intact. The bottom outlet valve cap was checked for tightness with a pipe wrench and was found to be loose (easily able to turn with a pipe wrench). The bottom outlet valve did not create a liquid tight seal while in the closed position in conjunction with an improperly tightened securement cap allowed the contents to leak out onto the ground.  The rail car has a faulty bottom outlet valve and will be transloaded in a shipper provided rail car. The leaking rail car will require an OTMA 1 to move to home shop for a qualified inspection and repair/requalification.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: On 05-06-2024 an FRA Hazardous Materials Safety Inspector performed a regulatory compliance check on tank car CGTX 31156 (Last Contained, Diesel Fuel, UN 1202, Class 3, PG II) at the CN Destrehan Yard in Destrehan, LA. The inspection revealed that (8) of (8) manway cover swing bolts were not properly fastened, the 2&amp;quot; vapor valve was in the fully opened position with it&amp;#x27;s securement plug not attached, the 3&amp;quot; liquid valve securement plug was not attached. The inspector also noted a diesel type odor upon opening the protective housing. The inspector notified the CN Dangerous Goods Officer of the findings. The CN DGO requested the tank car be placed on an accessible track for further investigation.  The responding CN DGO did not detect any diesel type odor upon opening the protective housing. A (4) gas with PID gas monitor was placed at the opening of the fully opened 2&amp;quot; vapor valve for several minutes. There were no detectable LEL or VOC readings emanating from the open valve or within the protective housing cover. The gas monitor was also placed next to the un-secured manway cover for gas detection purposes. There were no LEL or VOC&amp;#x27;s detected.  The vapor valve was closed, and its securement plug was applied utilizing a 24&amp;quot; pipe wrench. The liquid valve securement plug was applied utilizing a 24&amp;quot; pipe wrench. The (8) manway cover swing bolts were tightened with a 24&amp;quot; pipe wrench. The placards on the tank car (combustible liquid) were not consistent with the shipping papers (flammable liquid) and were replaced.  CGTX 31181 On 05-06-2024 an FRA Hazardous Materials Safety Inspector performed a regulatory compliance check on tank car CGTX 31181 (Last Contained, Diesel Fuel, UN 1202, Class 3, PG II) at the CN Destrehan Yard in Destrehan, LA. The inspection revealed that the bottom outlet valve cap was less than tool tight (could be turned by hand), (8) of (8) manway cover swing bolts were not properly fastened, the 2&amp;quot; vapor valve was not in the fully closed position with it&amp;#x27;s securement plug not attached, the 3&amp;quot; liquid valve securement plug was not attached. The inspector also noted a diesel type odor upon opening the protective housing. The inspector notified the CN Dangerous Goods Officer of the findings. The CN DGO requested the tank car be placed on an accessible track for further investigation. The responding CN DGO did not detect any diesel type odor upon opening the protective housing. A (4) gas with PID gas monitor was placed at the opening of the partially open 2&amp;quot; vapor valve for several minutes. There were no detectable LEL or VOC readings emanating from the open valve or within the protective housing cover. The gas monitor was also placed next to the un-secured manway cover for gas detection purposes. There were no LEL or VOC&amp;#x27;s detected.&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: The truck and trailer hauling a water tank and agricultural sprayer was traveling south on a county gravel road 47th Ave. SW,  9.5 miles north of Hwy 21. Driver met an oncoming pickup truck, slowed down to 10 miles per hour  and moved over to make room to pass the oncoming vehicle.  The trailer wheels were pulled into the ditch as the soft shoulder of the gravel road gave way. As the driver continued forward the trailer pulled the truck drive wheels into the ditch and at this moment the truck and trailer tipped over. The IBC of the ag pesticide WideARmatch that was inside the secured carrier on the trailer deck flipped over and the product that was inside the IBC flowed out the 1-1/2 inch vent hole cap that is located on top of the IBC and it was in an open position to vent.  That product spilled onto the ground and the release was about 10 minutes. Some product soaked into the ground and floor dry was placed on the remaining liquid pooled up under the shuttle.&lt;/li&gt;

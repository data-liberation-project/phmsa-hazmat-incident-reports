                &lt;li&gt;Description: The transport was headed West on HWY 39 when the driver turned to enter the Enable Naples unload station, Crude Oil began to spill along side the trailer. The transport stopped and proceeded to call his supervisor. When the supervisor arrived, along with internal environmental personnel it was determined that driver was responsible for the spill.  The driver did admit he had failed to close the fire valve and vent line valve on his trailer.   The environmental clean up crew and local authorities were alerted. The environmental crew arrived at 7:53am.  They spread powder absorbent on the highway and used a street sweeper to cleanup the residue.  No waste was generated and no manifest produced for disposal. Work was completed at 8:33am.  There was a local sheriff vehicle at the intersection at  5am but they left as soon as CRCT personnel arrived.  No other authorities from Grady County were ever on site.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

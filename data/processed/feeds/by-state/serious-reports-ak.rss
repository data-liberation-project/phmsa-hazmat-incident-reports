                &lt;li&gt;Description: On November 27, 2024, at 1647 ET, Emergency Response and Training Solutions (ERTS) was contacted by Landstar personnel in Wisemen, AK regarding the release of EMBR18276A. Contractors were dispatched to the site to perform all onsite clean-up activities. Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of 350 gallons of EMBR18276A (UN1993, 3, II) from (1) 350-gallon metal tote onto the ground. The release was reportedly due to a loose camlock fitting, impacting 30’ x 40’ and 8’ x 15’ areas of snow. No drains or waterways were impacted by the release. The release was cleaned up with absorbents and the proper PPE. Impacted snow was removed and containerized. All waste generated from addressing this release was containerized in (12) 55-gallon DM, which were then taken offsite by the contractor for proper disposal.&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: XPO Logistics terminal XDM experienced a UN3082 Mesotrione 40% SC release from a 135-gallon poly tote. ERTS dispatched contractors to conduct cleanup operations. Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 2-gallons of product released to a 10’ x 15’ area of the concrete dock floor due to a puncture caused by other freight during dock operations. The material was transferred from the damaged tote into a new one for shipment on. Absorbents were then deployed and worked into the impacted area. The damaged tote was cut up and containerized along with all impacted absorbents, pads, and PPE into (4) 55-gallon poly drums. The waste was staged onsite for terminal personnel to manage.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: On Sunday, Febuary 25, 2024, a CN mechanical performing an inspection observed that the bottom outlet valve appeared to be leaking from tank car # GBRX 703408 along with a strong Ethanol type odor in the area. The employee notified the Transportation Manager who in turn notified the CN Dangerous Goods Team. The tank car was set out to an isolation track (WA90) for inspection by a CN emergency response contractor. A CN emergency response contractor was dispatched to the location for mitigation. The contractor performed an inspection of the tank car and found the bottom outlet valve to be leaking from the threads of the bottom outlet valve cap. It was determined that there was a failure in the sealing surface of the valve seat to include a defective gasket. (The BOV cap was found to be tool tight and the BOV in the closed position and pinned upon initial inspection). CN emergency response contractor did observe cable seal to be correctly in place. The BOV valve handle was cycled several times to the open and closed position to free any debris that may have been trapped in the BOV sealing surface potentially causing the leak. The BOV cap was then removed and observed for 20 minutes to ensure there was no further leakage from the valve. It was noted that the BOV cap gasket was deformed and was replaced. The bottom outlet valve cap was then re-installed and tightened with a 36&amp;quot; pipe wrench. Upon tightening the BOV cap, CN emergency response contractor proceeded to place new cable seals on the BOV / Cap.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Non-Hazmat Fatalities: 0&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: Environmental Works was dispatched to the site. Upon the contractorâ€™s arrival, personnel observed that the released material impacted a 40ft-by-20ft area of the concrete terminal floor and estimated that one hundred and fifty (150) gallons of material was released due to forklift damaging one (1) poly tote. Environmental Works personnel deployed a neutralizer and then a granular absorbent to the impacted area. The remaining material was transferred to a new poly tote. The spent material was recovered and placed into three (3) 30-gallon poly drums, one (1) 55-gallon metal drum and one (1) 55-gallon poly drum along with the cut-up damaged poly tote. Environmental Works personnel then pressure washed the impacted area and collected the impacted water and containerized the recovered material into one (1) 330-gallon poly tote. The generated waste was staged onsite at the terminal in a secure location prior to the contractor demobilization. The generated waste will remain onsite for the ESTES DGRM team to coordinate disposal.&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: On Sunday, Febuary 25, 2024, a CN mechanical performing an inspection observed that the bottom outlet valve appeared to be leaking from tank car # GBRX 703408 along with a strong Ethanol type odor in the area. The employee notified the Transportation Manager who in turn notified the CN Dangerous Goods Team. The tank car was set out to an isolation track (WA90) for inspection by a CN emergency response contractor. A CN emergency response contractor was dispatched to the location for mitigation. The contractor performed an inspection of the tank car and found the bottom outlet valve to be leaking from the threads of the bottom outlet valve cap. It was determined that there was a failure in the sealing surface of the valve seat to include a defective gasket. (The BOV cap was found to be tool tight and the BOV in the closed position and pinned upon initial inspection). CN emergency response contractor did observe cable seal to be correctly in place. The BOV valve handle was cycled several times to the open and closed position to free any debris that may have been trapped in the BOV sealing surface potentially causing the leak. The BOV cap was then removed and observed for 20 minutes to ensure there was no further leakage from the valve. It was noted that the BOV cap gasket was deformed and was replaced. The bottom outlet valve cap was then re-installed and tightened with a 36&amp;quot; pipe wrench. Upon tightening the BOV cap, CN emergency response contractor proceeded to place new cable seals on the BOV / Cap.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

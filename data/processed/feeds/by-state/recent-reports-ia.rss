The material was transferred from the damaged tote into a new one for shipment on. Absorbents were then deployed and worked into the impacted area. The damaged tote was cut up and containerized along with all impacted absorbents, pads, and PPE into (4) 55-gallon poly drums. The waste was staged onsite for terminal personnel to manage.&lt;/li&gt;

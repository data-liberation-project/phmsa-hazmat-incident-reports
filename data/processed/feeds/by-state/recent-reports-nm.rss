                &lt;li&gt;Description: On October 29, 2024, at 1513 ET, Emergency Response and Training Solutions (ERTS) was contacted by Landstar personnel in Albuquerque, NM regarding the release of corrosive fryer &amp;amp; grill cleaner. Contractors were dispatched to the site to perform all onsite clean-up activities. Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of 1 cup of Keystone Fryer &amp;amp; Grill Cleaner (UN1824, 8, II) from (1) 1-gallon jug into the carboard box that it was contained in. The release was reportedly due to a load shift, impacting the carboard along with other jugs of product in the box. No drains or waterways were impacted by the release. The release was cleaned up with the proper PPE. All waste generated from addressing this release was containerized in (1) 5-gallon DF, which was then taken offsite by the contractor for proper disposal. All salvaged product was packaged in (1) 55-gallon DM and kept by the client per instruction.&lt;/li&gt;

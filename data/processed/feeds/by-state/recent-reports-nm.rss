                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: No&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: SequenceEvent: I feel that when the shipper sent out the package the caps were never closed correctly. Which led to the leaking in the package during transit. Because package was never opened or anything. But when I discovered the package, I just was giving it a look and it looked dried, but you can tell it was leaking for a few hours. So, I just got gloves and got the whole package and opened it up and saw caps were loose which caused the leaking. DescribePack: Loose caps and they were about 9 qts and 8.52 lts bottles. And the location of leaking came from top of bottle where the lid wasn&amp;#x27;t closed correctly. DurationRel: 6 and MitigateEffect: I believe in transit there was nothing they could do but bring it back to station. Where I quickly discovered package and handled the situation. So, it wouldn&amp;#x27;t have leaked anywhere else.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: I was notified that intermodal tank SNEU144870 was leaking from the bottom and there was a strong odor around the tank.  Response contractor E3 was sent to investigate. Upon arrival, the E3 supervisor inspected the intermodal tank and was unable to determine where the release was coming from.  He stated that the product was releasing from the jacket at three locations and that he believed there was a failure in the tank somewhere.  I had E3 contain the release using granular absorbent under the trailer then order a frack tank, a vacuum truck and the necessary materials to transfer the tank if needed.  I began to respond with an estimated 4 hour travel time, arriving at about 0300.    While driving I obtained a waybill, total trace and made contact with the shipper, Schneider National.  I spoke with a representative from Schneider and advised him of the issue.  The Schneider representative advised that they have had issues with these type of tanks, beginning with the numbers 144, having cracks in the tank and leaking product through the jacket.  This tank, SNEU144870 fit the description.  Schneider and I began making plans to transfer the product to another Schneider tank.  At about 0300 I arrived and inspected the tank.  As found by E3, the valves and fittings were secure but there was obvious product dripping from three locations underneath from seams in the jacket.  At about 0915, Schneider tank SNEU 145278 arrived on site and we transferred the turpentine from the 144870 to it.  The Schneider contact and I discussed pulling pieces of the jacket off of the tank in order to allow product inside to drip out at a quicker pace.  After the transfer I removed about three square feet of fiberglass jacket and saturated insulation, allowing the majority of product that was still there to drip leak out.  I could see no obvious release points.  Once it was done dripping we placed absorbent pads in the holes so that Schneider could schedule moving the tank from the UP yard.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

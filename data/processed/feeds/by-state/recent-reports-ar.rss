                &lt;li&gt;Description: SequenceEvent: The hazmat pkg was on a closure cart in the middle area by our chutes where the closures and misloads go. I had checked on the package earlier to see where it needed to go, and did not see any leaking around the package. Someone had grabbed the cart that the package was on, and put it on the rollers attached to the chute, and about 30 minutes later, I heard the manager call out that there was a leaking Hazmat. I ran over to the area, and the manager, a PH, and another QA were picking up the leaking, corrosive Hazmat with their bare hands, putting it into a tote, and making the package leak everywhere. I immediately told them to set the package down and to clear the area. I let them know that it was a corrosive liquid and that it could burn them. They had already set it on the tugger, and it was leaking all over the back of the tugger as well. They set it down, and I grabbed it, and put it on my QA cart. When I set it on the cart, the liquid splashed up on my arms and on my left leg (as I was wearing shorts), and it started burning my skin. I told them to immediately clear the area, go rinse their hands, and I took my cart to the QA area, and hurried to the Hazmat shower to start rinsing my arms and leg off. After I had rinsed off for about 8 to 10 mins, I then went back and got the tugger that had been leaked on, and took it to the QA area to put it out of order. I then took my QA cart to the Hazmat cage and put the damaged portion of the package into a lined salvage drum. DescribePack: Package failed due to a loose cap on one of the bottles of Warewashing Detergents. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: I went to the spill area, and put the chemical neutralizer onto the spilled liquid and then put the shredded absorbing material onto it as well. I put caution tape over the area, and the next morning, I pH tested several spots, as well as the spots on the tugger, and then put down more neutralizer as needed. I then waited until about 11:00a that morning to sweep up the neutralizer and absorbing material into a hazardous material bag, and place it into the salvage drum with the other damaged portion of the damaged package.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: 7-11-23: At approx 2100 hrs, in Morgantown WV our truck / trailer carrying UN,2312, Phenol, Molten, 6.1, II was flagged down. A mist from the top of the tanker trailer had landed on a car following our TT; Due to the HM product, EMS was activated. Fire, Police and HM responded. There was an light odor of the product in the air. A check of a valve at the top of the tanker revealed that hit was not fully closed. The driver had performed a pre trip inspection and the valve was closed at that time. No product was exiting the tank at this time. The product, which is not under pressure, would only be able to exit that valve while ascending or descending inclines. On flat ground the productÂ· would not be able to be released. The valve was secured by HM Responders. The tanker was allowed to complete the remainder of the trip ( Approx 1/2 mile) to be unloaded. Two passerbys claimed to be affected by the product. They were transported to a local hospital for observations, then released. C Three Logistics has contracted with a HM response cleanup operation to properly decontaminate the exterior of the affected motor vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

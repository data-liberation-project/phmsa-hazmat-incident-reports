                &lt;li&gt;Description: 1. X-2024040656 SequenceEvent: The Hazmat was loaded on a van and before dispatch the driver informed the package of the leak. The package handler immediately notified QA given the close proximity to the QA cage. QA notified management and responded to the spill. The damage packages were removed and placed in lined hazmat totes. The leak was contained and the spilled liquid was neutralized. DescribePack: Loose caps. Bottles are in a spill containment bag(failed) used by the shipper so it is unsafe to do an inspection without the risk of spilling the amount still left in the bag. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: Absorbent pads and neutralizer was used on the spilled liquid. The leaking hazmat was placed inside a line hazmat tote.   2.

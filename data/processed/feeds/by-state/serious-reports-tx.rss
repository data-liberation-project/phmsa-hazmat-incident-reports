                &lt;li&gt;Description: On April 7, 2025, at 1847, Emergency Response and Training Solutions (ERTS) was contacted by Landstar Inway personnel in Conroe, TX regarding the release of FLP MC-130 Conc. Contractors were dispatched to the site to perform all onsite clean-up activities. Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of 330 gallons of FLP MC-130 Conc. (UN1993, 3, III) from (1) 330-gallon poly tote onto the trailer floor and soil. The release was reportedly due to a load shift during transit, impacting the trailer floor and a 30’ x 50’ area of soil surrounding the trailer. No drains or waterways were impacted by the release. The trailer floor was cleaned up with absorbents and the proper PPE. The top layer of impacted soil was removed, then the harder layer underneath was secured for future excavation. 200 gallons of product were recovered from the ground and placed in a tote for potential recycling. The impacted absorbents and removed soil were containerized in (1) roll-off container which was taken offsite by the contractor for proper disposal along with the empty 330-gallon tote and recovered 200 gallons of product.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: XPO-Logistics contacted ERTS regarding a punctured leaking poly tote containing hazardous product, Barquat MB-50. A contractor dispatched and observed an estimated 140-gallon release onto the wooden trailer floor, the concrete beneath the trailer, the asphalt parking lot, and the soil. The trailer floor was impacted in a 20’ x 8.5’ area and the concrete beneath the trailer, asphalt, and soil were impacted in a 100’ x 75’ area. The contractor neutralized the release and applied oil dry. A vac truck extracted approximately 2,700-gallons of impacted rainwater and containerized it into one vac box. Three 55-gallon DF’s containing the cut-up tote, impacted oil dry, and impacted PPE were also generated. ERTS will coordinate disposal of the vac box. XPO will manage the drum waste created from the response. No storm-drains or waterways were involved in this incident.&lt;/li&gt;

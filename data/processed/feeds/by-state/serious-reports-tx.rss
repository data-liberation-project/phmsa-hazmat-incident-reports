                &lt;li&gt;Description: Loaded trailer was on our yard in Beaumont, TX when it was discovered to be Ieaking from a flange. The emergency shut off was used in hopes of stopping the leak. This attempt did not work because the product was actually coming from the flange above the external valve. Proper PPE was donned and the pressure was released from the top of the trailer. This slowed the leak down enough for our shop supervisor to don the proper PPE and check all the bolts and nuts on the flange. We found two nuts were very loose. These nuts were tightened up and the leak was completely stop. After our immediate investigation was completed, we discover that the two nuts that were lose had two lock washers that had flattened out not allowing the nuts to stay tight.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

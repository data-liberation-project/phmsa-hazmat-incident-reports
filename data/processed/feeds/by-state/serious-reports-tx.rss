                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: ***Upon notification, I contacted Code 3 to respond with a crew and I was enroute.  I was advised by yard personnel that the cloud was on the top of the car and would &amp;quot;cycle&amp;quot;, starting and stopping, and all personnel were clear of the area and there was no movement in the yard, except for the mainline.  Upon Code 3 arrival, the car was assessed and determined to have a PRD instead of a rupture disc.  The leak was coming from the liquid connection flange, there was no cloud and was wisping out faintly.  Code 3 exited the car and updated me.  I contacted Reagent Chemical and advised him of the incident and was provided photos of how the flange should look with a gasket visible between the red and black spacers.  Code 3 climbed the car and completed a more thorough inspection and found that the liquid flange bolts were easily turned by hand and no gasket was visible.  The bolts were tightened and the off gassing slowed.  There was moisture in the air which reacted with the HCL vapor and created a pH of 1 on top of the liquid line.  The car was decontaminated with soda ash and water and the off gassing stopped.  The car was moved to the Rip track, yard operations resumed, and there was no off gassing during the move.  The air flange was removed to check for pressure and a vacuum was on the car.  Then the liquid flange and spacer was removed, no gasket was installed, so a neoprene gasket was installed, and the liquid flange and spacer reinstalled.  No further issues.  Reagent Chemical sent a certified repair personnel out the afternoon of 1/29/25, installed a new gasket, checked the car for other issues, and prepped the car for Home Shop.  Car is still in HZ hold.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

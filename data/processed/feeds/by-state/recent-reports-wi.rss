                &lt;li&gt;Description: On December 19, 2023, one (1) 1,200-pound super sack of UN1325 was punctured by a forklift and released approximately five (5) pounds of product to the trailer interior. R+L Carriers retained Cura Emergency Services, LC who dispatched a crew from Valley Environmental Response (VER) to remediate the impacted site. VER personnel utilized absorbents and hand tools to remediate the UN1325-impacted trailer. The damaged super sack was overpacked into one (1) non-damaged supersack and all waste was collected and containerized into one (1) additional super sack for transport and disposal.&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Non-Hazmat Fatalities: 0&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: • We had weather issues right out of the gate with freezing.  Product freezes at 50-52 degrees • Initially when he opened the trailer and customer valves (internal and external) nothing was flowing.   • Stopped, shut compressor off, closed the airline and internal and external.  Bled the pressure off the line.  No pressure was on the line or product.  Used 50 foot airline and blew heat on the QRB to warm it up.  Gave up on that.  The customer had steam so they heated the valve.  Got product flowing.   • He had 2 hoses to make delivery.  He had a wall to his right side and the back of the truck.  As such the first hose had to loop around to get it under the trailer to the wall where there was a 6” hole where part of his second hose went through the wall and connected to the customer fill line 3-4 feet inside.  After the fill line hook up there is a shut off valve roughly 8” after that.  The fill line then goes vertical to the ceiling and then over and in to the tank.     • The product (Bevrosheen) was very slushy.  This was tied to compartment 3. • At the end of the offload he saw the hose rise up and could feel the hose was light.   • He shut down and then cracked his external open and walked the line to the customer tank and shut their fill line and the internal and external valves on the trailer.   • At this point he went to bleed the pressure off the hoses but the chicago cap for the bleeder valve was froze on.  He used a screw driver to break it free.  He then lifted his pale up to the bleeder valve and opened it  ¼ of the way and nothing came out.  He continued to open it more and nothing came out.  Both he and the unloader knew that it must be blocked with frozen product.  With the bleeder valve closed now he used a screw driver to get it clear of frozen product.  It then depressurized as expected when he opened the valve.  He commented that the amount of time it took to depressurize was consistent with how long it normally takes.  The process to get the bleeder valve clear from frozen product took roughly 3-5 minutes which is noteworthy as this was time the hoses with product inside were sitting idle in the cold weather • Richard was able to safely disconnect the hose (ie – any pressure in the hose in theory is clearly gone at this point) and reducer fitting from the trailer and then capped off the reducer fitting.  He kept the reducer fitting on that end of the hose attached as the unloader was going to take the reducer and two hoses and rinse them out together for our driver.  When the unloader got the one end of the hose with the reducer fitting on it near the wash station he laid it down and uncapped it again (again no pressure coming out of it).  Our driver now moved to the customer fill line and he loosened the camlock (right side) furthest away from him first and then the left side closest too him (following protocol) which is when the hose blew off of the fill line down towards the ground with a line of product shooting up at him.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

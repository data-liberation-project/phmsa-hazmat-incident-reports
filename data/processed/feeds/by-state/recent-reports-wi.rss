                &lt;li&gt;Description: While the Aircraft loading agents were unloading the cargo bin of our CRJ 200, and as the checked bag was going down the belt loader, the bag caught fire. Seeing flames and smoke, the fire was reported to local emergency responders. The bag was extinguished using a fire extinguisher before the responders could arrive on scene.  The crew and passengers were unaware if the incident occurred in flight or taxing to the gate. The duration of the event was only a few minutes until the items were extinguished. The aircraft cargo bin did not appear to have any damage and no smoke alarms inside the aircraft were reported. The aircraft was grounded until further inspections was made.  Upon closer inspection of the bag, there was a small hole that had burned through the bag. Two of the personal electric battery powered items inside the bag were charred. An undetermined brand of cell phone and a Remington beard trimmer. It is undetermined which item caused this event. The national response center was notified shortly after the event.&lt;/li&gt;

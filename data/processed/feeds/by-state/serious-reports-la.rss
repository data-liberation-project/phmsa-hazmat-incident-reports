                &lt;li&gt;Description: Incident Report: Transportation Package Failure and Release Response Sequence of Events Leading to the Incident: On the morning of June 16, 2025, at 8:26 AM, Driver Carnest Nutall contacted dispatch to report that he had run his truck and trailer off the road and into a ditch at the curve where County Road 174 intersects Bob Wilson Road, while traveling northbound. The unit involved was Truck RC-34 pulling Trailer 107, both loaded with chemical product identified under BOL 1150607. The material being transported was M2Guard-HSR105G, manufactured by Foremark Performance for M2 Chemical. The driver was approximately 15 minutes from the delivery location at the time of the incident. Driver Nutall reported that he was unable to stop the truck and trailer due to apparent brake failure. The posted speed limit for the curve was 15 mph, as confirmed by photographs taken at the scene, which also documented tire marks showing the vehicle sliding off the road and rolling. Actions Taken at the Time of Discovery: The driver immediately notified dispatch and confirmed that he had sustained injuries to his head and lower back, but no other vehicles or individuals were involved. Local law enforcement was notified, and Officer Cliff Lance (Phone: 318-426-499) responded to the scene. The Louisiana State Police accident hotline was contacted at 10:19 AM; the call was taken by Amanda, who provided Incident #2121, which was initially given by Officer Lance. E3 Environmental was contacted to oversee environmental remediation and cleanup. They will be providing a cost estimate and handling hazardous materials containment. Nolan&amp;#x27;s Towing was notified to upright the truck and trailer and coordinate safe offloading of the contents. A secondary trailer, TX-18, operated by Driver Alan Reeves, was dispatched to receive the chemical transfer from the damaged trailer. Description of Package Failure: • The trailer was fully loaded with 45k of M2Guard-HSR105G at the time of the accident. Due to the trailer rolling into a ditch, there is potential for container displacement or compromise, though a full damage assessment was pending at time of report. While no visible punctures, cracks, or leaks were initially confirmed via driver call, an on-site inspection was ordered noticed some seepage from washout cap on dome lid area. Photographs taken at the scene showed clear evidence of road departure, slide marks, and the overturned position of the truck and trailer. • Any cracked, punctured, or ruptured drums will be identified by E3 Environmental and reported under separate documentation. Estimated Duration of Release: The exact duration of any material release is currently unknown pending E3&amp;#x27;s assessment. However, based on the time of the call (8:26 AM) and environmental response initiation (around 12:30 PM). Scene secured by law enforcement to prevent unauthorized access or ignition hazards. Environmental contractor (E3 Environmental) dispatched for cleanup, product containment, soi&lt;/li&gt;

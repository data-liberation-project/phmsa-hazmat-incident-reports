                &lt;li&gt;Description: Driver encountered deteriorating roadway conditions on his way to make delivery to the customer. At some point driver claims that a 3rd party driver veered into his lane causing him to take minor evasive action. This lead to loss of control when he contacted an icy road surface. The tanktruck rolled into the median where it came to rest. Ther was a rupture of a vapor valve as well as the diesel fuel tank. Luckily due to the cold weather only minor amounts of ammonia were lost through the vapor break. The police and local fire department were called to the scene to set up roadblocks and control the area.  The Huntsville, AL Hazmat team eventually made it to the site to assess the situation. It was deemed feasible to set the truck upright and tow away to a remote location for product offload and depressurization. Fugitive vapors were controlled by water application by the FD. A fuel cleanup team has been assigned to remove soil and diesel fuel as well.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

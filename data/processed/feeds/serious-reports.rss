                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: The incident report was filed due to spillage of Diesel Fuel from the saddle tank from the power unit. The CMV jackknifed causing the  saddle tank to be crush and releasing diesel fuel on the roadway.   The driver failed to maintain control of the CMV and struck a guard rail. The roadway was wet and under construction (repaving) and the surface was uneven. No other vehicles were involved and no injuries were reported.  A local Hazmat clean-up company (ECOtech, 50 Easy Street, London, KY. 40741) responded to the scene. They tapped the fuel tank and transferred the contents to slow/stop the leak. The materials used were hydrocarbon exsorbent pads, absorbent booms, recovery drum, skid steer, and a dump truck for disposal.&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: Driver was traveling approximately 65 MPH westbound on I-20. He was traveling in the far right lane, when he fell asleep at the wheel. He awoke to stopped traffic in front of him without enough time to come to a safe stop. The driver jerked the wheel to the right to avoid contact with the vehicles in front of him and left the road way. He overturned on a side embankment at MM-43. Upon impact of the crash, a weld in the tank ruptured as well as one of the manhole covers on the top of the trailer. The product slowly leaked out of the trailer for approximately 1 hour. Other vehicles in traffic that witnessed the incident dialed 911. The driver contacted his employer, who in turn contacted Marion Environmental who was closer to the scene and could mitigate the release of gasoline quicker and more efficiently than the carrier could themselves. They set up absorbent booms to control the spilled product. The remainder of the product was pumped over into another trailer and safely transported to the original destination.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: On 7/5/2024 at 3:42 AM Central Time, Canadian Pacific Kansas City Railroad (CPKC) train 242-03 derailed 29 rail cars at milepost 342.86 on the Carrington Sub near the town of Bordulac, North Dakota.  Derailed cars included six loaded tank cars transporting UN1230, Methanol, 3, PG II, RQ (Methanol), eleven loaded tank cars transporting UN1005, Ammonia, Anhydrous, 2.3(8), Toxic Inhalation Hazard, Zone D, Marine Pollutant (Ammonia, Anhydrous), RQ (Ammonia), and twelve loaded hopper cars transporting non-hazmat Polyethylene pellets. CPKC mobilized internal and railroad qualified external resources to investigate the damage and mitigate released lading. Fire was reported immediately after the derailment, with multiple cars on fire. Many of the derailed tank cars experienced heat impingement. Because of this, pressure built within tank cars caused pressure relief devices to release product into the atmosphere.  Additionally, releases occurred from holes and punctures in tank shells, and from damage incurred to manways, valves, pressure regulating devices, and other tank car appurtenances. The NTSB is investigating this incident and has requested that CPKC refrain from modifying any tank cars until it has completed its work.  Because of this, CPKC has not been able to fully assess damage which might have occurred under tank jackets. The following information is the best information available at this time.  The cars detailed below released the listed amounts in gallons from the following locations:  1) PROX 45220, loaded Methanol, Release=0.00 - minor damage to tank car did not result in a release. 2) CTCX 300362, loaded Methanol, Release=13,558.25 - heat impingement affected integrity of manway gasket (121-Gasket 308-Leaked 512-Fire, Temperature, or Heat) &amp;amp; pressure Relief Device (PRD) activated (144-Pressure Relief Valve or Device – Reclosing 313-Vented 512-Fire, Temperature, or Heat). 3) TILX 355610. loaded Methanol, Release=26,035.55 - tank shell was punctured on the right side between the housing and the B-End, and on the left side of the tank car directly below  the housing  (150-Tank Shell 309-Punctured 509-Derailment), liquid line valve separated from the pressure plate (134-Liquid Valve 312-Torn Off or Damaged 509-Derailment), PRD sheared off at the pressure plate (144-Pressure Relief Valve or Device – Reclosing 312-Torn Off or Damaged 509-Derailment), &amp;amp; 4/6 manway securement bolts were damaged. (105 Bolts or Nuts 312 Torn Off or Damaged 509 Derailment) 4) MFCX 132265, loaded Methanol, Release=26,526.48 - tank shell was punctured on the B-End &amp;amp; A-End (150-Tank Shell 309-Punctured 509-Derailment), the liquid valve sheared off at the flange (134-Liquid Valve 312-Torn Off or Damaged 509-Derailment), &amp;amp; the vapor valve &amp;amp; PRD sheared off at pressure plate (158 Vapor Valve 312-Torn Off or Damaged 509-Derailment) (144-Pressure Relief Valve or Device – Reclosing 312-Torn Off or Damaged 509-Derailment) 5) CTCX 300358. loaded Methanol, Release=27,849.02 -&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: A semi truck tipped over, hitting a reflector post while taking NB Highway 52 ramp from WB Interstate 90. The incident was reported to the authorities and an emergency response team was called to help. Bay West field staff arrived on site and checked with Olmstead County Hazmat Team and Rochester Fire. A safety briefing was held prior to any assessment or cleanup activities began.  Two field staff suited up in level B PPE to make and initial assessment of the spill. During the initial incident assessment, the semi truck was observed to have overturned onto its side on the Hwy 52 Northbound ramp. The totes and drums within the trailer were flipped from their original position and were sitting with the openings resting on the roof of the trailer. The contents of some of the containers were observed to be still leaking onto the trailer and running out into the vegetation within the right of the way. A large plume of vapor was observed exiting a hole within the roof of the trailer due to a reaction from the chemicals. (It is believed that the vapor was from the non-hazmat products). Entry into the trailer was made to collect PH sample from the products on the floor, assess damage to the containers, and take an inventory of the contents.  Due to the products still gassing, causing a plume of vapor, a confined space fan was set up to vent out the trailer while staff were working. After the initial assessment was conducted, a cleanup plan was made to pump out and transfer the container into new totes. Field Staff began setting up and prepares to transfer the remaining product from the containers. Two staff made entry into the trailer and began to make openings into the hydrogen peroxide totes so a stinger pipe could be used to reach the bottom. Once all of the hydrogen peroxide totes were transferred, 55 gallons of water were flushed through the hoses and pump to decontaminate it before moving onto the next product. After the flush, field staff continued the same process to the remaining products within the trailer until all the totes were empty.  A second crew arrived on site to relieve the initial response crew. A safety briefing  was conducted along with a discussion about the remaining work prior to the first crew mobilizing off site. The second crew began with recovering and overpacking the remaining drums within the trailer. Four drums were still intact, three of the drums were observed to be compromised and damaged, and one drum was empty. The three compromised drums were overpacked and prepared for transport. Once all of the drums were removed, absorbent pads were used to recover any remaining product from the trailer. After all of the product was removed from the trailer, a wrecking crew arrived to upright the semi and move it off site to their storage yard. All of the drums and the waste product that was transferred into totes was delivered to a MnDOT facility in Stewartville until disposal could be arranged. The total transferred product tota&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: On September 17, 2024, at 1141 ET, Emergency Response and Training Solutions (ERTS) was contacted by Landstar personnel in Lithonia, Georgia regarding the release of NALCOÂ® BT-3011 BOILER WATER TREATMENT.  Contractors were dispatched to the site to perform all onsite clean-up activities. Upon arrival, contractors confirmed the release of 260 gallons of Nalco BT-3011 Boiler Water Treatment (Sodium Hydroxide Solution, UN1824, 8, III) from (1) IBC plastic tote. The release was caused by a puncture and impacted the trailer floor, and multiple small areas of concrete as the trailer was in motion, that were unrecoverable. The residual material in the damaged tote was neutralized and solidified with absorbents, the damaged tote was cut up, then the trailer was neutralized and cleaned. Contractors also confirmed a 1ft x 6inch area of soil was impacted. Contractors were able to collect the impacted soil without complication. All waste was containerized in (4) 55-gallon DFs and taken offsite by contractors for proper disposal.&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: At 23:00 ET, XPO notified ERTS of a cargo release at terminal NNA. It was reported that approximately 137.5 gallons of UN3266 Natural HDPE FCL13 released from a plastic tote due to a pole on another piece of freight puncturing the tote during the unloading process. The release impacted inside of trailer #3153521 and asphalt. ERTS reviewed the SDS with the caller and determined that terminal personnel are not capable of cleaning the release with PPE available on site.  Contractors arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 180-gallons of product released to a 300-yard x 400-yard are of the asphalt lot as well as the trailer floor. Absorbents were deployed and worked into the impacted areas. The remaining material in the tote was transferred into a new one. The damaged tote was then cut up and containerized. All impacted absorbents and the cut up poly tote were then containerized into (3) 55-gallon metal drums. The waste was staged onsite for terminal personnel to manage.&lt;/li&gt;

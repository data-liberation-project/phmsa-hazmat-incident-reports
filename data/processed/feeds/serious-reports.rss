                &lt;li&gt;Description: Order was placed for material for 1900 gallons.  Tank was a 1550-gallon tank, drivers are instructed to fill tanks to 7/8 to allow room for them to blow out their lines.  The driver arrived onsite and hooked up to the tank without any incident. o l. On most occasions the entire load of material should fit into the tank and near the end of the load is when you tend to have issues where the tank gets full. Driver filled tank and initially reported that there was a 5-15 gallon spill out of the top of the tank when he was blowing out his line. •. On 01/22/25 when we received the paperwork and telemetry on the tank it was calculated the actual amount of the spill was 642 gallons. This is above the RQ of 1 0001bs.  This was reported to NCR# 1422616 on 01/22/25. A clean-up crew (TAZ Environmental) was contracted to clean the containment area. PVS learned that Ferric Chloride had been pumped into frac tanks from containment and needed to be cleaned out and contracted a new remediation company Miller Septic was contracted. Clean-up of the Ferric Chloride material has been completed.&lt;/li&gt;

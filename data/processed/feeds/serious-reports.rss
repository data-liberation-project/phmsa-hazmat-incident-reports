                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: Our driver was transporting a tractor trailer tanker with 11,498 gallons of gasoline heading northbound on Route 60 near the village of Sinclairville, NY. He was traveling at 54 mph when another vehicle traveling southbound turned left in front of our unit. This other vehicle&amp;#x27;s windshield was covered with snow and ice blocking the driver&amp;#x27;s view. This action caused our tractor trailer to rollover striking the guardrail and over turn. The entire unit came to rest upside down against two trees.  Local Sinclairville Fire Emergency response arrived and it was discovered that compartment #1 (3000 gallon capacity) had two puncture wholes mid level and at the top of the tanker. Emergency response used a wax ring to plug the lowest leak point. Compartment #1 retained 486 gallons of gallons of the 3000 loaded. Estimated leak time was under 20 minutes and the leak was halted at that time. The remaining product in 4 compartments retained the original gallons loaded.  Additional resources and Emergency Responders were brought in to assist. Our company transferred to remaining gasoline to another trailer once the trailer was air drilled. New York State DEC was present and monitoring all activities.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

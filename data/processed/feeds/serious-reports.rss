                &lt;li&gt;Description: a consist of 5 Iocomotives(2 of which was a mother/slug set PAL 2119/PAL 2112) that was fueled and prepared for an evening outbound train at the Paducah Diesel shop(3700 Starnes Avenue) was transported from the shop to the north end of paducah yard(approximately 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile) to put on oubound train set to depart that evening. The crew first used the power to pull some cars from the rip track to set over into a track and then backed in to track #8 to couple into outbound train before.pulling it to the north end of yard to stage for outbound crew. Once train was parked at north end of track#8, the conductor noticed fuel Ieaking from the PAL 2119 mother Iocomotive out the overflow on fuel tank. The crew reported it to diesel shop immediately and were instructed to shut the fuel transfer breaker off on the slug unit PAL 2112 and the leak stopped. E3 environmental(Enhanced Environmental and Emergegency) was contacted and showed up to yard to clean all affected areas. Clean up was completed and all tracks put back in service at 2050. The manual transfer switch on the PAL 2119 was later determined to be the cause of the overflow. The PAL 2119 was calling for fuel transfer when it was already full. This switch was replaced to prevent event from happening again.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

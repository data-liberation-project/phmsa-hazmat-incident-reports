                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: The driver of the vehicle was driving at approximately 60 mph when he felt a drop on the backend of the vehicle.  At that time, the driver lost control of the vehicle and began to fishtail and then the vehicle rolled onto its top. A  witness to the incident informed the driver that he had lost his back passenger wheels off the truck in transit and this caused the loss of control. It was determined that the wheel studs had completely broken off causing this to happen. The wreck and rollover are what caused the damage to the packaging of the chemicals. The duration of the release was approximately 45 minutes. Creedence immediately contacted an emergency response hazmat  clean up crew and got them to the location of the incident. They immediately began containing the spill from spreading and cleaning what had been spilt. Creedence notified the National Response Center of the spill and  TCEQ was on site directing the clean up the following day.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: On March 12, 2024 at 1421 ET, Emergency Response and Training Solutions (ERTS) was contacted by Landstar personnel in Orange, Texas regarding the release of approximately (225) gallons of FERRIC SULFATE SOLUTION, Corrosive Liquid, Acidic, Inorganic, n.o.s. (UN3264, 8, III). Contractors were dispatched to the site to perform all onsite clean-up activities. Upon arrival, contractors investigated and confirmed the release was caused by a load shift due to a hard brake and was contained to the trailer floor and a 100ft x 6ft area of asphalt trailing behind the unit. Contractors neutralized the release then used absorbents and the proper PPE to clean the release. Contractors were able to transfer the remaining product in the damaged tote to a new tote without complication. All waste generated from addressing this release was containerized in (7) 55-gallon DFâ€™s, which was then taken offsite by contractors for proper disposal. **The NRC report has the city of Beaumont (which the spill took place in Orange City), this 5800 report was completed to match the NRC report for fluidity**&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: Driver was traveling north bound on I-75 north of Flint, MI when he was pulled over by Michigan State Police at 16:15 ET for a lane restriction violation. Upon inspection of the tractor/trailer, the trooper detected a leak coming out from under the ss skin on the bottom of the trailer just in front of the rollover protection. A tub was placed underneath the leak to contain it until the cleanup crew from Michigan Spill Response arrived on scene. After a short period of time, the leak stopped and there was only residue on the trailer. At that time, the top of the trailer was visually inspected and right above the area of the leak, there was a 3&amp;quot; washout cap that had fresh residue in the area which indicated that it had leaked. When Michigan Spill Response arrived on scene, they went to the top of the trailer and determined that the front washout cap was loose. They removed the washout cap, inspected the gasket, and then secured the washout cap to the threaded connection. After replacing the cap, a surge test was conducted on site and the trailer showed no signs of of any further leakage. Michigan Spill Response cleaned the residue from the trailer and disposed of the product that was collected in the catch pan placed underneath the trailer. Once the residue was removed rom the trailer, the load continued on without further incident. L&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

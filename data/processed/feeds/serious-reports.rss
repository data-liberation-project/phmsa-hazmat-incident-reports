                &lt;li&gt;Description: On Friday, May 17, 2024, a Occidental Chemical driver made a delivery of Hydrochloric acid to the Occidental Chemical plant located in Hahnville, LA. The Occidental Chemical driver was loaded at an IMTT facility located in Geismar, LA. While the unloading process was underway, it was discovered that the bleeder valve on the product transfer line that goes to the product storage tank was left open. This resulted in approximately 2600 gallons of Hydrochloric acid being released from the product line into the containment area. No injuries or exposure to chemical occurred as a result of this event, as well as no off-site impact or environmental impact. The offloading process was halted, bleeder valve closed, containment area drained to sump for processing, and remainder of offload was completed.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: The CTMV was travelling northeast on NC 222.  The truck drove off the right side of the roadway, overcorrected, and then skidded across the center line and overturned onto its side. The CTMV rolled onto the passenger side of the vehicle across NC 222.  During the rollover the force of impact caused the manway failure. Approximately 2,000 lbs. of emulsion spilled from the tank onto the ground. A hazardous materials contractor recovered the spilled emulsion and remediated the soil. The cost for the cleanup and remediation is still pending final notification from the contractor.&lt;/li&gt;

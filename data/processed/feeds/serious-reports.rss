                &lt;li&gt;Description: On 04/16/2025, at 19:19 hours, CSX personnel, reported train M64515 transporting car FURX 894276 (Load, Crude Zinc Oxide) was leaking a white material from a hole in the bottom of the hopper car. The reported location was mile post AN 753.00 on the Dothan subdivision, near the Fox Lane crossing, in Donalsonville, GA.  The initial cause of the release was damage to the hopper body which has resulted from mechanical failure of the car&amp;#x27;s truck assembly.  Marion Environmental, Inc. (MEI), a CSX emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the incident.  Upon arrival, contractor personnel confirmed two wheel burns to the hopper body which resulted in product spillage.  Contractor personnel patched the holes, and the car was held pending unloading or movement under OTMA.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Description: On March 6, 2024 GATX 73828 was shipped from Dyno Nobel in Carthage, MO to Cornerstone Chemical in Westwego, LA.  This was the final destination and Cornerstone Chemical received the car and maintained possession of it during the period of March through August 2024, and until the incident was mitigated.  On August 7, 2024, Cornerstone Chemical was moving the car inside their facility, when employees discovered a pinhole leak near the top of the tank.  Cornerstone Chemical notified the NRC and initiated a hazardous materials response and cleanup.   Cornerstone Chemical contracted with third-party companies to transfer the remaining contents from the tank car and cleanup the spill.  The tank car was scrapped.  On April 5, 2025, Dyno Nobel received a letter from PHMSA instructing Dyno to submit a hazardous materials incident report.&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Serious Incident Ind: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Description: On July 16, 2024, at 9:30am, Kenan Advantage Group truck and LNG trailer arrived at the Rexburg LNG Facility. IGC Vaporization Technicians (Vap Tech) began preparation for offload. The LNG trailer pressure was increased to approximately 60 psig, the transfer hose was connected to the LNG trailer, the purge valve at the truck Offloading Skid was opened and the hose was purged.  At 10:10am, the Vap Tech slightly opened the LNG trailer fill and drain valve. Vapor and LNG began to release from the vent stack at the back of the LNG trailer. The Vap Tech immediately left the hazardous area and attempted to relieve pressure from the LNG trailer, as it was initially believed the LNG was being released from the LNG trailer relief valve. The emergency shutdown (ESD) at the back of the LNG trailer was in the hazardous area and not accessible.  At 10:15am, a local methane detector at the Offloading Skid alarmed and initiated an emergency shutdown.  At 10:35am, the Vap Tech pushed a secondary ESD, located near the front of the trailer, to close the fire blocks on the LNG trailer. The fire blocks did not shut off and stop the release of LNG resulting in the LNG flowing into the concrete spill pit at the facility.  At 10:45am, the Fire Department arrived onsite, and evacuations began at 11:30am. Seventeen (17) residential buildings (approximately 30 people) were evacuated. The Vap Techs continued to monitor the atmosphere with gas detectors from a safe distance.  At 2:54pm, the area was deemed safe, and the Vap Techs shut in the system.  At 3:30pm, the evacuations were lifted.  At 4:47pm, the Rexburg LNG Facility was returned to normal operation.   Upon incident investigation, it was discovered when the fill and drain valve was slightly opened, the LNG flowed through the fill line bleed valve on the LNG trailer, into the vent piping, and sprayed out of the vent stack. The fill line bleed should have been verified to be closed before opening the fill and drain valve. It was also discovered that the secondary failure of the fire block valve not closing caused the LNG to continue to release into the concrete spill pit.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
